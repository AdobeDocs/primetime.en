  <title>Tokenized segment streams</title> 
  <shortdesc>HLS streams that are delivered through a Content Delivery Network
	 (CDN) can sometimes use authentication tokens on the manifest and segment
	 requests for verification. These tokens can be provided as URL parameters or as
	 cookie headers. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Tokens provided as cookies on the master manifest (m3u8) response are
		not shared with the segment (ts) requests even when the segment requests are
		for the same domain. To enable the sharing of these cookies in a segment
		request, set the following property on the 
		<codeph>PTMetadata</codeph> instance provided to the player item:Â  
		<codeblock outputclass="syntax objective-c">PTMetadata *metadata = [[[PTMetadata alloc] init] autorelease];
[metadata setValue:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES] forKey:kSyncCookiesWithAVAsset];
</codeblock> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>An additional request is made to the master manifest (m3u8) before the
		stream begins to play. 
	 </p> 
	 <note type="important">This cookie-sharing feature is only supported on
		devices running iOS 8 or above.
