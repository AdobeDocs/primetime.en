  <title>Customize playback with ads</title> 
  <shortdesc>When playback reaches an ad break, passes an ad break, or ends in
	 an ad break, 
	 <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> defines some default behavior
	 for the positioning of the current playhead. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <note type="tip">You can override the default behavior by using the
				<codeph>PTAdPolicySelector</codeph> class. </note> 
	 <p>The default behavior varies, depending on whether the user passes the ad break during normal
			playback or by seeking in a video. </p> 
	 <p>You can customize ad playback behavior in the following ways: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_D20E40AE092D4516937BD7E18ACA2409"> 
		<li id="li_7D2A6B7717E54B2DA08234E7F9A45B66">Save the position where the
		  user stopped watching the video and resume playing at the same position in a
		  future session. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_A1FBF1F028984C12956F66750450F446">If an ad break is presented
		  to the user, display no additional ads for a number of minutes, even if the
		  user seeks to a new position. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_6B6FC23F681A4CBCB670E562D93131C6">If the content fails to play
		  after a few minutes, restart the stream or fail over to a different source for
		  the same content. 
		  <p>On the failover playback session, to allow the user to skip ads and
			 resume to the previous failed position, you can disable pre-roll and/or
			 mid-roll ads. 
			 <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> provides methods to
			 enable skipping pre-roll and mid-roll ads. 
		  </p> 
		</li>
