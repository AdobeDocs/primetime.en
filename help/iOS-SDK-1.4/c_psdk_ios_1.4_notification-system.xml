  <title>Notifications for player status, activity, errors, and logging</title>
  
  <shortdesc><codeph>PTNotification</codeph> objects provide information about changes in player
		status, warnings, and errors. Errors that stop the playback of the video also cause a change
		in the status of the player. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Your application can retrieve the notification and status information. You can also create a
			logging system for diagnostics and validation by using the notification information. </p> 
	 <note  type="important"> 
		<p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> also uses <term>notification</term> to refer to
					<codeph>NSNotifications</codeph> (<codeph>PTMediaPlayer</codeph> notifications)
					<term>event</term> notifications, dispatched to provide information about player
				activity. </p> 
	 </note> 
	 <p ><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> also issues 
		<codeph>PTMediaPlayerNewNotificationItemEntryNotification</codeph> when
		it issues 
		<codeph >PTNotification</codeph>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You implement event listeners to capture and respond to events. Many events provide
				<codeph>PTNotification</codeph> status notifications. </p>
