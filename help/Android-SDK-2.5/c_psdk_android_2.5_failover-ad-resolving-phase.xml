  <title>Ad-resolving phase</title> 
  <shortdesc> <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> contacts an ad delivery service, such as 
	 <ph conkeyref="phrases/auditude-name-long"/>, and attempts to obtain the
	 primary playlist file that corresponds to the video stream for the ad. During
	 the ad-resolving phase, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> makes an HTTP call to the remote ad-delivery
	 server and parses the server's response. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p> <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> supports the following types of ad providers: 
	 <ul id="ul_496D1DBDB9924C9AAD18B326254F3C1F"> 
		<li id="li_85CBA090938B4F39B29A6BEFDF3377C6">Metadata ad provider 
		  <p>The ad data is encoded in plain-text JSON files. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_FC1ECFBDB224403AB47A9897E624FFBD"><ph
		  conkeyref="phrases/auditude-name"/> ad provider 
		  <p> <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> sends a request, including a set of targeting parameters and
			 an asset identification number, to the 
			 <ph conkeyref="phrases/auditude-name"/> back-end server. 
			 <ph conkeyref="phrases/auditude-name"/> responds with a synchronized
			 multimedia integration language (SMIL) document that contains the required ad
			 information. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_5E4613ECCBBD4BDF959C1E827CB7C22E">Custom ad markers provider 
		  <p>Handles the situation where ads are burned into the stream, from the
			 server side. <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> does not perform the actual ad insertion, but it needs to
			 keep track of the ads that were inserted on the server side. This provider sets
			 the ad markers that <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> uses to perform the ad tracking. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>One of the following failover situations can occur during this phase: 
	 <ul id="ul_A895B72F53E64D108ABB54F74915B0FE"> 
		<li id="li_BB40EF88C58D4488AA19BD10012E6085">The data cannot be retrieved
		  because, for example, of the lack of connectivity or a server-side error, such
		  as a resource cannot be found, and so on. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_D8148CDA20BF4CC8B4AE1B54B9489750">The data was retrieved, but
		  the format is invalid. 
		  <p>This might occur because, for example, the parsing of the inbound
			 data failed. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p> <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> issues a warning notification about the error and continues
		processing. 
	 </p>
