  <title>Buffering</title> 
  <shortdesc>To provide a smoother viewing experience, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> sometimes buffers
	 the video stream. You can configure how the player buffers. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> defines a playback buffer length of at least 30 seconds and an
		initial buffer time before the media starts playing, of at least 2 seconds.
		After the application calls 
		<codeph>play</codeph>, but before playback begins, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> buffers the
		media up to the initial time to give a smooth start when it actually starts
		playing. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You can alter the buffer times by defining new buffering policies, and
		you can alter when the initial buffering occurs by using instant on.
