# Getting started

After installing TVSDK, you can build a video application in stages. You can learn and incorporate TVSDK features as you go. For examples of how to use TVSDK features, you can refer to the ReferencePlayer application and source code that are included in the TVSDK delivery from Adobe.
Begin with a basic player as described in  content-playback-options . You can add features as you see the need for them. The sub-topics in that section describe features, mostly on by default, that Adobe uses to make the video playback experience as enjoyable as possible.
Advertising is an important component of most video applications. Adobe provides an infrastructure for including advertising in video content, and TVSDK gives you access to that infrastructure.  ad-insertion  explains how.
Adobe also provides sophisticated tools to enable your video application to make contenteasily available to authorized users while protecting it from theft and unauthorized distribution.  drm-content-security  explains how.
Another component of the Adobe video infrastructure is a video analytics facility that TVSDK can make available to your application.  va_integration-overview  shows how to use that capability.
