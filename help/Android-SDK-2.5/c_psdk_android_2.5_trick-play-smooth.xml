  <title>Smoother trick play operations</title> 
  <shortdesc>If your system has access to hardware-assisted decoding, you can
	 achieve smoother trick play than with the pure software <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> implementation by
	 using iFrame format.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <section id="section_3DBFD7A3D1C7453096D3D3885E786263"> 
		<p>Using iFrame format results in trick play operations that are not
		  smooth. Smoother trick play operation uses a normal (not iFrame) profile,
		  hardware decoding support, and an increased frame rate. Different
		  hardware-assisted decoding devices have different capabilities. Double speed
		  requires 60 frames per second (FPS), and quadruple speed requires 120 FPS. 
		</p>
		<note type="important">Adobe recommends that you limit playback to double
		  speed for newer Android devices and not use the feature for older Android
		  devices.
		</note> 
		<p>To achieve smoother trick play, set <codeph>ABRControlParameters.maxPlayoutRate</codeph> to the
				desired multiple of normal speed (for example, 2.0 for double speed). If a
				subsequent call to <codeph>MediaPlayer.setRate()</codeph> has an argument that is
				less than or equal to the value you set for <codeph>maxPlayoutRate</codeph>, <ph
					conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> uses a normal profile to achieve
				smoother trick play. Otherwise it uses an iFrame profile for the trickplay
				operation. </p>
