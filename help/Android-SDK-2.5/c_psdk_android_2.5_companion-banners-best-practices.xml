  <conbody> 
	 <p>When displaying companion ads, follow these recommendations:
	 <ul id="ul_7DA7FE62D6B74975891D555B3B9B0643"> 
		<li id="li_A13F0B930F064FA3AE7A10DB7371F43F">Attempt to present as many
		  of a video ad's companion banner ads as will fit in your player's layout. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_91ACEDA129FE4F36AEB5087441A9A51C">Present a companion banner
		  only if you have a location that matches the ad's specified height and width. 
		  <p>
			 <note type="important">Do not resize the ad.
			 </note>
		  </p>
		</li> 
		<li id="li_03BF3C29F24B486F9330FFDB8DA7FED3">Begin presenting the
		  companion banner(s) as soon as possible after the ad begins. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_60C22B7FE3934AC6A2C315028615B9AC">Do not overlay the main
		  ad/video container with companion banners. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_007E2B0F6A074AF785819112A96AC161">You can display companion
		  banners after the ad ends.
		  <p>The standard practice is to display each companion banner until you
			 have a replacement for the ad. 
		  </p>
