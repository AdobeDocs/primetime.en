  <title>Playback and failover</title> 
  <shortdesc>Streaming over the Internet requires a constant and stable
	 connection to play a stream from a remote server. However, the variability of a
	 viewer's Internet connection or streaming playback means that remote playback
	 might not have the quality of media that is played locally. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <note type="important">Primetime cannot protect from failures such as an
		ISP outage or a cable disconnection. 
	 </note> 
	 <p>Primetime streaming provides failover protection to protect playback
		from certain remote server failures or operational failures, which makes a
		better viewing experience. Despite transmission problems, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> implements
		failover protection to minimize playback interruptions and achieve a seamless
		playback. The video player automatically switches to a backup media set when
		entire renditions or fragments are unavailable.
