  <title>Notifications and events for player status, activity, errors, and logging</title>
  
  <shortdesc><codeph>MediaPlayerStatus</codeph> objects provide information about changes in player
		status. <codeph>Notification</codeph> objects provide information about warnings and errors.
		Errors that stop the playback of the video also cause a change in the status of the player.
		You implement event listeners to capture and respond to events
			(<codeph>MediaPlayerEvent</codeph> objects). </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
  	<p>Your application can retrieve notification and status information. Using this information, you
			could also create a logging system for diagnostics and validation. </p>
