  <title>Instant On</title> 
  <shortdesc>Enabling instant on means that one or more channels are preloaded.
	 When users select a channel or switch channels, the content plays immediately.
	 The buffering is complete by the time the user starts watching. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Without Instant On, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> initializes the media to be
			played but does not start buffering the stream until the application calls
				<codeph>play</codeph>. The user sees no content until buffering is complete. With
			Instant On, you can launch multiple media player (or media-player item loader)
			instances, and <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> starts buffering the streams
			immediately. When a user changes the channel and the stream has buffered properly,
			calling <codeph>play</codeph> on the new channel starts playback immediately. </p> 
	 <p>Although there are no limits to the number of 
		<codeph>MediaPlayer</codeph> and 
		<codeph>MediaPlayerItemLoader</codeph> instances that <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> can run,
		running more instances consumes more resources. Application performance can be
		affected by the number of instances that are running. For more information
		about 
		<codeph>MediaPlayerItemLoader</codeph>, see

	 </p> 
	 <note type="important"><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> does not support a single
				<codeph>QoSProvider</codeph> to work with both <codeph>itemLoader</codeph> and
				<codeph>MediaPlayer</codeph>. If the customer uses Instant On, the application needs
			to maintain two QoS instances and manage both instances for the information.  </note>
