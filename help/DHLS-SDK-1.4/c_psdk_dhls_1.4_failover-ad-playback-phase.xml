  <title>Ad-playback phase</title> 
  <shortdesc> 
	 <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> downloads the ad segments and
	 renders them on the device's screen. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>At this point, 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> has resolved ads, positioned
		them on the timeline, and attempts to render the content on the screen. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The following main classes of errors might occur in this phase: 
	 <ul id="ul_0A3733247EBC4862ACC716824C2493B6"> 
		<li id="li_9C53D0CBAF05410F977D7EBCB0B8EBC3">Errors when connecting to
		  the host server 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_6A8345EE32CB49D889ACD14856E8EB63">Errors when downloading the
		  manifest file 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_05C4E2733AD9486FBE82C9E3CFD32684">Errors when downloading the
		  media segments 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>For all three error classes, 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> forwards triggered events to
		your application, including: 
	 <ul id="ul_8E08713DF63E4B07B0A82FCA8CE56877"> 
		<li id="li_BD44F4CF59BE4D3B9229664D6BB833A4">Notification events
		  triggered when a failover happens. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_73F6E611974E40AB90CCBC6BACF76C98">Notification events when the
		  profile is changed because of the failover algorithm. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_A56C48379CF44373A4B19027619D581A">Notification events
		  triggered when all failover options have been considered, and no additional
		  action can be taken automatically. 
		  <p>Your application needs to take the appropriate action. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Whether or not errors occur, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> calls
				<codeph>AdBreakPlaybackEvent.AD_BREAK_COMPLETE</codeph> for each
				<codeph>AdBreakPlaybackEvent.AD_BREAK_STARTED</codeph> and
				<codeph>AdPlaybackEvent.AD_COMPLETED</codeph> for every
				<codeph>AdPLaybackEvent.AD_STARTED</codeph>. However, if segments could not be
			downloaded, there might be gaps in the timeline. When the gaps are large enough, the
			values in the playhead position and the reported ad progress might exhibit
			discontinuities. </p>
