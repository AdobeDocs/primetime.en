# Companion banner ads

When displaying companion ads, follow these recommendations: 
* Attempt to present as many of a video ad's companion banner ads as will fit in your player's layout.
* Present a companion banner only if you have a location that exactly matches its specified height and width. 
  >[!TIP]
  >
  >Do not resize the banner.

* Present the companion banner(s) as soon as possible after the ad begins.
* Do not overlay the main ad/video container with companion banners.
* Continue to display companion banners after the ad ends. The standard is to display each companion banner until you have a replacement for this banner.
