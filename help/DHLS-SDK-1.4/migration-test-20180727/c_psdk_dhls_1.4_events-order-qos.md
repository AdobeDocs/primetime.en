# QoS events

The following example shows a typical progression of these events: 
```
// For buffering 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(BufferEvent.BUFFERING_BEGIN, onBufferingBegin); 
private function onBufferingBegin(event:BufferEvent):void { ... } 
 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(BufferEvent.BUFFERING_END, onBufferingCompleted); 
private function onBufferingCompleted(event:BufferEvent):void { ... } 
 
// For seeking 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(SeekEvent.SEEK_BEGIN, onSeekBegin); 
private function onSeekBegin(event:SeekEvent):void { ... } 
 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(SeekEvent.SEEK_COMPLETED, onSeekCompleted); 
private function onSeekCompleted(event:SeekEvent):void { ... } 
 
...  SeekEvent.SEEK_POSITION_ADJUSTED...  //if the desired 
// seek position is modified by the current advertising policies 

```
