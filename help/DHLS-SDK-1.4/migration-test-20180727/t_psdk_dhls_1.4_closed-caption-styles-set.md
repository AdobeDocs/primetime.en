# Set closed-caption styles


>1. Wait for the MediaPlayer to have at least the PREPARED status (see  ui-state-prepared-wait-for ).
>1. To change the styling settings, do one of the following:
>    * Use the `ClosedCaptionStylesBuilder` helper class (operates on `ClosedCaptionStyles` behind the scenes).
>    * Use the `ClosedCaptionStyles` class directly.
>   Setting the closed-caption style is an asynchronous operation so it might take up to a few seconds for the changes to appear on the screen.>
