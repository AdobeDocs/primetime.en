# Display a seek scrub bar with the current playback position


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Seeking in a live stream is allowed only for DVR.


>1. Set up callbacks for seeking.
>       Seeking is asynchronous, so  <!-- PH element: phrases/primetime-sdk-name --> dispatches the following seek-related events:
>    
>    * ` SeekEvent.SEEK_BEGIN` - Seek starting.
>    * ` SeekEvent.SEEK_END` - Seek successful.
>    * ` SeekEvent.SEEK_POSITION_ADJUSTED` -  <!-- PH element: phrases/primetime-sdk-name --> readjusted the seek position provided by the user.
>    
>1. Wait for the player to be in a valid status for seeking.
>   Valid states are PREPARED, COMPLETED, PAUSED, and PLAYING.
>
>1. Listen for the appropriate event to see when the user is scrubbing.
>1. Pass the requested seek position (milliseconds) to the ` MediaPlayer.seek` method.
>
>   ```
>   function seek(position:Number):void;
>   ```
>   You can seek only in the assetâ€™s seekable duration. For video on demand, the duration is from 0 through the asset's duration.

>   >[!TIP]
>   >
>   >This moves the play head to a new position in the stream, but the final computed position might differ from the specified seek position.
>
>1. Wait for  <!-- PH element: phrases/primetime-sdk-name --> to dispatch the ` SeekEvent.SEEK_END` event.
>1. Retrieve the final adjusted play position using event.actualPosition.
>       This is important because the actual start position after the seek can be different from the requested position. Various rules might apply, including: >    
>    * Playback behavior is affected if a seek or other repositioning ends in the middle of an ad break or skips ad breaks.
>    * If you seek near a segment boundary, the seek position is adjusted to the beginning of the segment.

>    
>1. Use the position information when displaying a seek scrub bar.
