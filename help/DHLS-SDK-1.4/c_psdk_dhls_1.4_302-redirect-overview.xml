  <title>HTTP 302 redirect optimization</title> 
  <shortdesc>302 redirect optimization minimizes the number of 302 redirect
	 responses, which allows your application to load balance more effectively. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p> If a main manifest request is redirected, and 302 optimization is
		enabled in your player, subsequent requests made for assets from that manifest
		will use the final domain location, which avoids additional 302 responses. 
	 </p>
	 <p  >This feature is disabled by default, and
		you can change this setting.
	 </p>
	 <p  > If you enable this feature, it works
		correctly only if 
		<i>all</i> of the following conditions are true; otherwise, no redirect
		optimization occurs, and 302 responses continue to occur: 
	 <ul id="ul_D96DD2D8307448C69172A8E717FA3D1E"> 
		<li id="li_9FCB741E708840F3835725A5F0327360">Your application was
		  compiled for 
		  <ph conkeyref="phrases/flash-player-long"/> 11.8, using 
		  <codeph>-swf-version</codeph> 21 or higher. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_7BE220DBDB1647EB82051CB694637CD9">Your end users have 
		  <ph conkeyref="phrases/flash-player-long"/> 11.8 or later installed. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <note  type="important">To ensure that cookies are passed
		with ad requests, disable 302 redirect. When 302 redirect is enabled, the ad
		request might be redirected to a domain that is different from the domain from
		which the cookie originated.
