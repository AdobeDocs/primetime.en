# Content and manifest requirements

Check the restrictions and requirements for streams and playlists (manifests), including DRM encryption keys.


|  Adobe Access DRM  | If the DRM-protected stream is multiple bit rate (MBR), the DRM encryption key used for the MBR should be the same as the key used in all the bit-rate streams.  |
|---|---|
|  Ad variant manifests  | Must have the same bit-rate renditions as the renditions of the main content.  |
