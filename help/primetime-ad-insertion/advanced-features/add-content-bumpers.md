# Add content 'Bumpers' {#adding-content-bumpers}

Media companies may need to place 'bumpers' around their content for branding purposes, sponsorships and/or to meet government requirements. Primetime Ad Insertion provides a number of ways to place bumpers without baking them into the actual content. Contact your Primetime Support representative for more information.
