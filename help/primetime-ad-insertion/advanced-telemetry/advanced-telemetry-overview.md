# Advanced Telemetry {#advanced-telemetry}

Customers have the ability to use Primetime Ad Insertion to capture ad-related events and metrics to uncover the key causes of ad errors and get other insights into ad performance.  This data is captured at the raw request level, giving operators the ability to debug specific VAST or VMAP tags coming directly from providers.
