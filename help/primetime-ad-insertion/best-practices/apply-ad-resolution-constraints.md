# Apply Ad Resolution Constraints {#apply-ad-resolution-constraints}

There may be cases where particular ad providers are slow to respond, which can cause video start-up times to increase. Primetime Ad Insertion supports timeouts of ad requests and the entire ad resolution phase to limit the impact of these slow ad providers. For more information, see [`ptadtimeout` parameter in Bootstrap API](/help/primetime-ad-insertion/technical-reference/bootstrap-api.md).
