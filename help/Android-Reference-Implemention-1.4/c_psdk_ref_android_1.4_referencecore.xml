  <title>ReferenceCore</title> 
  <shortdesc>The ReferenceCore acts as an adaptor between third-party user
	 interface elements and a <ph conref="../../phrase_library.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/> DefaultMediaPlayer instance.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>The ReferenceCore includes methods to configure and create the player
		viewport, get token authorization for Flash Player features, create feature
		managers and event handlers, configure the MediaPlayerView and instantiate the
		<ph conref="../../phrase_library.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/>'s DefaultMediaPlayer.
	 </p>
	 <p>The ReferenceCore is where you will enable or disable the optional
		feature managers.
