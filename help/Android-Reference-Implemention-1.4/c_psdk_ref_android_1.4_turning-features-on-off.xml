  <title>Turning features on or off using ManagerFactory</title> 
  <shortdesc>You can turn features on or off without going through the code by
	 using the manager factory. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>The enablement argument in the example below determines whether the
		feature is used or not. If it is false, the feature manager is created but
		provides just the default functionality to the player, as if the feature
		manager were not created. If it is true, the feature manager is created, the
		feature is enabled, and the media player accepts input from the configuration
		file. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>For example, in the
				<filepath>com.adobe.primetime.reference.ui.player.PlayerFragment.java</filepath>
			file: </p> 
	 <codeblock outputclass="syntax java" >adsManager = ManagerFactory.getAdsManager(<b>true</b>, config, mediaPlayer);</codeblock>
