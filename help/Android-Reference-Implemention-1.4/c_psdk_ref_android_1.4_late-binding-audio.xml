  <title>Late-binding audio</title> 
  <shortdesc>You can enable and build controls for late binding audio.

  <conbody> 
	 <p>The HLS standard allows multi-format streams, which means we can keep
		the audio and video tracks of a stream separate from each other. The video
		track, with multiple renditions (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p, and 1080p) and the
		audio tracks (e.g., English, Spanish, French, German) can be encoded
		separately. The media player then chooses the desired video and audio tracks
		and binds them on the fly, on the client side. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You can implement various workflows, depending on your player user
		interface. The general workflow for the Primetime player is as follows:

	 <ol id="ol_A0EDD327234248C8A2D5B97AFE0938CE"> 
		<li id="li_63059FD183984D9FAA29D7F4C8DAAFF8">When the end user selects a
		  video, a list of available audio tracks for that media item is populated. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_403271CED7F04560B8331B1D813658E7">When the user taps the
		  Settings button on the UI, the audio track options are displayed. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_3B32EF1CF9A24E388B48668118B5B943">When an audio track is
		  selected, the track becomes the active audio track. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_2366D687E5274B7EB1C83587298B540C">The end user can tap the
		  Settings button to switch back to the original audio track.
