# DVR without ad insertion

You can enhance the player control bar for DVR with the following additional features: 
* Hide the current playback timestamp and remaining timestamp on the sides of the control bar.
* Highlight the seekable range in the control bar.
* Change the duration of the control bar to be the seekable range of the stream instead of the playback range of the stream. The seekable range is a subset of the playable range in which ads can be inserted safely.

* Choose a custom starting point for when to enter a stream.
