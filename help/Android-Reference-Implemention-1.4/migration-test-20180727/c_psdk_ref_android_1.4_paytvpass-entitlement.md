# Primetime authentication entitlement flows

The feature manager that encapsulates the  entitlement flows is the `EntitlementManager`. This class encapsulates the entitlement logic while delegating the UI work to elsewhere. 
This Reference Implementation for Android uses the  AccessEnabler library version 1.7.3. Much of the implementation is very similar to the existing demo application provided with the AccessEnabler library.
