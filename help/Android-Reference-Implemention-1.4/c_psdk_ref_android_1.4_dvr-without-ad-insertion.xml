  <title>DVR without ad insertion</title> 
  <shortdesc>By default, a live stream with DVR support exposes a seekable
	 range in which the viewer can pause and seek. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>You can enhance the player control bar for DVR with the following
		additional features: 
	 <ul id="ul_FEBAF3F6173740CCA3F0172625036B1E"> 
		<li id="li_DD20A4B567184CF2B261044601CE74DB">Hide the current playback
		  timestamp and remaining timestamp on the sides of the control bar. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_C22252D202124099B2604E79359FCB2A">Highlight the seekable range
		  in the control bar. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_74933D70BD5A4163BF3EB4E39DCFC779">Change the duration of the
		  control bar to be the seekable range of the stream instead of the playback
		  range of the stream. 
		  <p>The seekable range is a subset of the playable range in which ads
			 can be inserted safely. 
		  </p>
		</li> 
		<li id="li_CEF6E7B6BB4142F1963F53FB4E3A1708">Choose a custom starting
		  point for when to enter a stream.
