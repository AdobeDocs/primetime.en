			provides various statistics, including the frame rate, the profile bit rate, the total
			time spent in buffering, the number of buffering attempts, the time it took to get the
			first byte from the first video fragment, the time it took to render the first frame,
			the currently buffered length, and the buffer time. <p>The reference implementation
				provides a <codeph>QoSManager</codeph> class where you can enable the display of the
				QoS overlay. You can also enable the QoS visibility in the Settings user interface:
