 <title>Video Analytics</title>
 <shortdesc>You can easily track video by integrating a <ph
      conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/>-based app with
    your Adobe Analytics account.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The integration of Adobe Primetime <ph
    conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/> with Adobe
   Analytics allows you to track video data in your Android applications. This integration between
   the <ph conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/> is referred
   to herein as <i>video analytics</i>. </p>
  <p>This section of the reference implementation guide summarizes how video analytics has been
   implemented in the Primetime Android Reference Implementation, and describes how you can enable
   and configure video analytics in your <ph
    conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/>-based player based
   on the reference implementation. </p>
  <p>The video analytics implementation is disabled by default in the reference implementation.
   Before you can track video data, you need to have a working Adobe Analytics account. You then
   have to configure the video analytics component of the reference implementation with your Adobe
   Analytics account information.</p>
