  <title>How to use the Primetime reference implementation</title> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>The Primetime reference implementation is a modular player that has been broken down into
			individual features that you can easily modify through specialized feature managers.
			These feature managers are used as a bridge to connect the application and the <ph
				conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/>
			library. </p> 
	 <p> You can use the reference implementation in the following ways: 
	 <ul id="ul_9309CC6E080F4E2A99516856F0F74B11"> 
		<li id="li_1D4B89AE255348918B35E6A73FED7F38">Use it as-is without
		  changing any code (all features are turned on with default values). 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_B124E6B9882D47CDBECE1C179B692274">Use it as a reference to understand how to use the
						<ph
						conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/>
					library. </li> 
		<li id="li_7F126889C60A4608AEEEAD8F3F037575">Pick and choose the features
		  that apply to your application by turning off the features that you don't use. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_80FCDF824F61412E9AA629FF6FC4A747">Customize the UI components
		  without making any changes to the features. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>We provide the Primetime reference implementation to help you understand the <ph
				conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"
			/> and easily modify the feature managers to customize your player. However, please
			refer to the <xref href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/psdk/android/index.html"
				format="html" scope="external">TVSDK 1.4 for Android Programmer's Guide</xref> for
			detailed information about the <ph
				conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"
			/> library. </p>
