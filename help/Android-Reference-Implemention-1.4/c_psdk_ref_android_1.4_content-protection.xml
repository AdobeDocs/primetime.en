  <title>DRM content protection</title> 
  <shortdesc>The Primetime player supports <ph
			conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/drm-short">AAXS</ph> integration
		as custom DRM workflows. This means that your application must implement the DRM
		authentication workflows before playing the stream. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>To enable this, <ph conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"
			/> provides you with the DRM manager for authentication. The reference implementation
			provides an example of the following workflows: <ul
				id="ul_9A5F9B3A3DE244E3885C22C91DE62900">
				<li id="li_CDFCD3A70DF046B1AF51369BC19102A0">How to load and play back HLS streams
					with Access content protection, optimized for low error rates and quick start
					up. </li>
				<li id="li_91257621FBA342D6A3A5846B59CE75DD">How to load and play back HLS streams
					with AES128 content protection. </li>
				<li id="li_81C0F1D569AB43E3A648B955F72A8905">How to load and play back HLS streams
					with PHLS content protection, optimized for low error rates and quick start up.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p> 
	 <p>All DRM-protected content is handled automatically by the DRM libraries built into the <ph
				conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/>.
			However, you can expose error handling, optimization of device individualization, and
			license acquisition using <ph
				conref="../../phrase_library_ref_impl.xml#c_psdk_phrase-library/primetime-sdk-name"/> API
			callbacks. </p>
