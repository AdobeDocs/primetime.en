# FlashVars

You can pass configuration parameters directly to the reference implementation from the ReferencePlayer.mxml file. You need to specify, in the ReferencePlayer.mxml file which method of configuration to use.

To use FlashVars, change the compiler options in the `codeph referenceplayer.html` file to use FLASHVARS.

The default behavior is to use the JSON catalog file.
