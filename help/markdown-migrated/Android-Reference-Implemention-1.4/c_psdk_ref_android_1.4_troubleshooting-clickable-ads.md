# Troubleshooting clickable ads


* If an ad has been properly configured with a click-through URL in  but the "More info" button does not show up, check the  ad request result to see if the click-through URL is included in the ad response. You can find the  ad request URL in the log. <!-- What log are we talking about here? I didn't find any URL information in the logs. Can I provide a path where they can find the log? -->
* If clicking the "More info" button does not launch a browser or the browser redirects to the wrong page, check the  response to ensure that it has a valid click-through URL.
