  <title>Notifications for player status, activity, errors, and logging</title>
  
  <shortdesc><codeph>MediaPlayerNotification</codeph> objects provide information about changes in
		player state, warnings, and errors. Errors that stop the playback of the video also cause a
		change in the state of the player. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Your application can retrieve the notification and state information. You can also create a
			logging system for diagnostics and validation by using the notification information. </p> 
	 <p>You implement event listeners to capture and respond to events. Many events provide
				<codeph>MediaPlayerNotification</codeph> status notifications. </p>
