  <title>Control closed-caption visibility</title> 
  <shortdesc>You can control the visibility of closed captions. When visibility
	 is on, the currently selected track is displayed. If you change which track is
	 current, the visibility setting remains the same.

		<note type="tip"> If closed caption text is displayed when the player
		  enters the seek mode, the text no longer displays after the seek completes.
		  Instead, after a few seconds, 
		  <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> displays the next closed
		  caption text in the video after the ending seek position. 
		</note> 
		<note>The visibility values for closed captions are defined in
					<codeph>MediaPlayer.Visibility</codeph>.
