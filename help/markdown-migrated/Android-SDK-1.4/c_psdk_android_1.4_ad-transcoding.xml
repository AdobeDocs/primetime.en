  <title>Repackage incompatible ads using Adobe Creative Repackaging
	 Service</title> 
  <shortdesc> Some third-party ads (or creatives) cannot be stitched into the HTTP Live Streaming
		(HLS) content stream because their video format is incompatible with HLS. <ph
			conkeyref="phrases/ad-insert-name"/> and <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>
		can optionally attempt to repackage incompatible ads into compatible M3U8 videos. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Ads served from various third parties, such as an agency ad server, your
		inventory partner, or an ad network, are often delivered in incompatible
		formats, such as progressive-download MP4. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>When <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> first encounters an incompatible ad, the
			player ignores the ad and issues a request to the <ph conkeyref="phrases/crs-name"/>
				(<ph conkeyref="phrases/crs-acronym"/>), which is part of the <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/ad-insert-name"/> back end, to repackage the ad into a compatible
			format. <ph conkeyref="phrases/crs-acronym"/> attempts to generate multiple-bit-rate
			M3U8 renditions of the ad and stores these renditions on the Primetime Content Delivery
			Network (CDN). The next time <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> receives an ad
			response that points to that ad, the player uses the HLS-compatible M3U8 version from
			the CDN. </p> 
	 <p>To enable this optional feature, contact your Adobe representative.</p>
