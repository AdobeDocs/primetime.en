  <title>Ad-insertion phase</title> 
  <shortdesc> 
	 <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> inserts the alternate content
	 (ads) into the timeline that corresponds to the main content. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>When the ad-resolving phase is complete, 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> has an ordered list of ad
		resources that are grouped into ad breaks. Each ad break is positioned on the
		main content timeline using a start-time value that is expressed in
		milliseconds (ms). Each ad in an ad break has a duration property that is also
		expressed in ms. The ads in an ad break are chained together one after another.
		As a result, the duration of an ad break is equal to the sum of the durations
		of the individual composing ads. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Failover can occur in this phase with conflicts that might occur on the
		timeline during ad insertion. For specific combinations of ad break
		start-time/duration values, ad segments might overlap. The overlap occurs when
		the last portion of an ad break intersects the beginning of the first ad in the
		next ad break. In these situations, 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> discards the later ad break
		and continues the ad-insertion process with the next item on the list until all
		ad breaks are inserted or discarded. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> issues a warning
		notification about the error and continues processing.
