  <title>Default and customized playback behavior with ads</title> 
  <shortdesc>The behavior of media playback is affected by seeking, pausing, 
	 <ph >fast forward or rewind (trick play
		mode), 
	 </ph> and the inclusion of advertising. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>To override the default behavior, use <codeph>AdBreakPolicySelector</codeph>. </p> 
	 <p> 
		<note type="important"> 
		  <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> does not provide a way to
		  disable seeking during ads. Adobe recommends that you configure your
		  application to disable seeking during ads. 
		</note> 
	 </p> 
	 <p >Here is the playback behavior for live/linear
		content: 
	 <ul id="ul_B69FFCAF53F84621B5FC982FB0209731"> 
		<li id="li_5F1AC52D7442427CBD285B1B93AB61AD">Resuming playback after a
		  pause results in the playback of the content that was buffered at the time of
		  the pause. 
		  <p>If the resuming position is still in the playback range, the
			 playback should be continuous. Otherwise, 
			 <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> jumps to the new live
			 point. You can also perform a seek operation and select a different playback
			 point. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_B6D1E3E1B1294074866009BC9B429D2A"><ph
		  conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> resolves ads between cues after the
		  position at which the application enters live playback. 
		  <p>Playback begins after the first cue is resolved. The default value
			 for entering live playback is the client live point, but you can choose a
			 different position. All cues before the initial position are resolved after the
			 application performs a seek in the DVR window.
