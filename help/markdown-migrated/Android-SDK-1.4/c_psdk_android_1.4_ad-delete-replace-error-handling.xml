<title>Ad deletion and replacement error handling</title>
    
    <shortdesc><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> handles time range errors according to
        the specific problem, either merging or reordering the improperly defined time ranges. </shortdesc>
    
<conbody>
    <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> deals with <codeph>timeRanges</codeph> errors by
            doing default merging and reordering. First, it sorts customer-defined time ranges by
            the <i>begin</i> time. Based on this sorting order, it then merges adjacent ranges, and
            joins them if there are subsets and intersections among the ranges.</p>
    <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> handles time-range errors as follows: <ul>
                <li>Out of order - <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> reorders the time
                    ranges. </li>
                <li>Subset - <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> merges the time-range
                    subsets. </li>
                <li>Intersect - <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> merges the intersecting
                    time ranges. </li>
                <li>Replace ranges conflict - <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> chooses
                    the replace duration from the earliest appearing <codeph>timeRange</codeph> in
                    the conflicting group.</li>
            </ul></p>
    <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> handles signaling-mode conflicts with ad
            metadata as follows:</p>
<p> 
         <ul>
             <li>If the ad signaling mode conflicts with the time-range metadata, the time-range
                    metadata always has priority. For example, if the ad signaling mode is set as
                    server map or manifest cues, and there are also MARK time ranges in the ad
                    metadata, the resulting behavior is that the ranges are marked, and no ads are
                    inserted.</li>
             <li>For REPLACE ranges, if the signaling mode is set as server map or manifest cues,
                    the ranges are replaced as specified in the REPLACE ranges, and there is no ad
                    insertion through server map or manifest cues. See <xref
                        keyref="ad-signaling-mode"/>. </li>
         </ul></p>
        <p>When the server does not return valid <codeph>AdBreaks</codeph>: <ul>
                <li><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> generates and processes a
                        <codeph>NOPTimelineOperation</codeph> for the empty
                    <codeph>AdBreak</codeph>. No ad plays.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p >For time ranges with live streams: 
          <ul>
             <li>Although this C3 ad delete/replacement feature is intended to be supported 
                 only for VOD, time ranges are processed for live streams as well if specified 
                 in the ad metadata.</li></ul></p>
