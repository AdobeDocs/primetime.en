  <title>Control closed-caption styling</title> 
  <shortdesc>  You can provide styling information for closed-caption tracks using the
			<codeph>ClosedCaptionStyles</codeph> class. This sets the style for any closed captions
		that are displayed by your player. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>This class encapsulates closed-caption styling information such as the font type, size, color,
			and background opacity. An associated helper class,
				<codeph>ClosedCaptionStylesBuilder</codeph>, facilitates working with closed-caption
			style settings. </p>
