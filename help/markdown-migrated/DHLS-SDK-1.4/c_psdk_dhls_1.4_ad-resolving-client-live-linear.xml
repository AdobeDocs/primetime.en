 xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"> 
  <title>Live/linear ad resolving and insertion</title> 
  <shortdesc>For live/linear content, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> replaces a chunk
		of the main stream content with an ad break of the same duration, so that the timeline
		duration remains the same.  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Before and during playback, 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> resolves known ads, replaces
		parts of the main content with ad breaks of the same duration, and recomputes
		the virtual timeline, if necessary. The positions of the ad breaks are
		specified by cue points that are defined by the manifest. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> inserts ads in the following
		ways: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_96102B4A192F46DDB89EAA1E248F1211"> 
		<li id="li_5FF13D2B6A8D47A18D3676378FEA08CE"><b>Pre-roll</b>, which is at
		  the beginning of the content. 
		</li> 
		<li 
		 id="li_7EE98D9B5A944D9BA0125452B8DE2460"><b>Mid-roll</b>, which is in the
		  middle of the content. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p> 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> accepts the ad break even if
		the duration is longer or shorter than the cue point replacement duration. By
		default, 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> supports the 
		<codeph>#EXT-X-CUE</codeph> cue as a valid ad marker when resolving and
		placing ads. This marker requires the metadata field 
		<codeph>DURATION</codeph> in seconds and the cue's unique ID. For
		example: 
		<codeblock>#EXT-X-CUE:DURATION=27,ID="..."</codeblock> 
	 </p> 
	 <note type="important" >When implementing a customary 
		<codeph>AdPolicySelector</codeph>, a different policy can be given to
		pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll 
		<codeph>AdBreakTimelineItem</codeph>s in 
		<codeph>AdPolicyInfo</codeph>, which is based on the type of the 
		<codeph>AdBreakTimelineItem</codeph>s. For example, you can keep mid-roll
		content after it has played but remove pre-roll content after it is played. 
	 </note> 
	 <p>After playback starts, the video engine periodically refreshes the manifest file. <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> resolves any new ads and inserts the ads
			when a cue point is encountered in the live or linear stream that was defined in the
			manifest. After ads are resolved and inserted, <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> computes the virtual timeline again and
			dispatches a  <codeph>TimelineEvent.TIMELINE_UPDATED</codeph> event. </p>
