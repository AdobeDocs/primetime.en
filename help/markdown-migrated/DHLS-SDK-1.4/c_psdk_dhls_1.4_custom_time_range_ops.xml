  <title>Custom time range operations</title> 
  <shortdesc>Ad deletion and replacement are implemented with custom markers that identify different types of time ranges in a VOD stream: mark, delete, and replace. For each  custom time range, you can perform associated operations, including deleting or replacing ad content. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>For ad deletion and replacement, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>
		includes the following 
		<i>custom time range operation</i> modes: 
	 <ul> 
		<li>MARK - Dispatches 
		  <codeph>AdBreak</codeph> events for the marked regions. (This was
		  called 
		  <codeph>customAdMarker</codeph> in previous versions of <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>.)
		  Ad insertion is not allowed in this mode. 
		</li> 
		<li>DELETE - For this mode, the
		  app uses the 
		  <codeph>TimeRangeCollection</codeph> class to define time regions for
		  C3 Ad Deletion. Ad insertion is allowed in this mode. 
		</li> 
		<li>REPLACE - In this mode, the app replaces a <codeph>timeRange</codeph> with an <ph
						conkeyref="phrases/auditude-name-long"/>
					<codeph>AdBreak</codeph>. The replace operation starts where the C3 Ad deletion
					occurs, and ends at the indicated time (shorter or longer than the original time
					range). </li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> provides a 
		<codeph>CustomRangesOpportunityGenerator</codeph> class to
		generate placement opportunities for the MARK and DELETE ranges. For the
		REPLACE mode, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>
		generates two placement opportunities for each time range: 
	 <ul> 
		<li>The 
		  <codeph>CustomRangeResolver</codeph> generates placement opportunities
		  for DELETE 
		</li> 
		<li>The 
		  <codeph>AuditudeAdResolver</codeph> generates placement opportunities
		  for INSERT 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
  </conbody>
