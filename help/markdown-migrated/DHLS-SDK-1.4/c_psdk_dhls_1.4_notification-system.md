# Notifications for player status, activity, errors, and logging

Your application can retrieve the notification and status information. You can also create a logging system for diagnostics and validation by using the notification information.

You implement event listeners to capture and respond to events. Many events provide `codeph MediaPlayerNotification` status notifications.
