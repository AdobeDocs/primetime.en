  <title>Buffering time policies</title> 
  <shortdesc id="buffering-policies">Depending on your environment (including
	 the device, the operating system, or the network conditions), you can set
	 different buffering policies for your player, such as changing the minimum
	 duration for initial buffering and for ongoing playback buffering. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>After you call 
		<codeph>play</codeph>, the media player begins buffering the video. When
		the media player has buffered the amount of video specified by the initial
		buffer time, playback begins. This process improves the start-up time because
		the player does not wait for the entire playback buffer to fill before starting
		playback. Instead, after the few initial seconds are buffered, playback begins.
		
	 </p> 
	 <p>While the video is being rendered, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> continues to
			buffer new fragments until it is has buffered the amount that is specified by the
			playback buffer time. If the current buffer length drops below the playback buffer time,
			the player will download additional fragments. Once the current buffer length is above
			the playback buffer time by a few seconds, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>
			will stop downloading fragments.</p> 
	 <note type="tip"> If the initial buffer value is high, it might give your
		user a long initial buffering time before starting. That might provide smooth
		playback for a longer time; however, if network conditions are poor, initial
		playback could be delayed.
