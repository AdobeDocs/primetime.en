				<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> includes API descriptions and code
				samples to help you to integrate advanced video functionality, content protection,
				and advertising features into your player. You use ActionScript to create a video
				player user interface. <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> helps you
				connect that user interface to its media player. This allows you to play videos and
				advertising based on media manifests. You can also use <ph
					conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> to retrieve information about the
				video, handle security, and control and monitor playback. </p> 
		<p>For specific hardware and software requirements for using 
		  <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>, see
