  <title>Ad loading for a DVR window</title> 
  <shortdesc>You can decide whether to resolve only the ads that occur after
	 the user’s current live point or to also resolve ads that occur before the
	 current live point.

  <conbody> 
	 <p>When a user starts to view content at the beginning of a DVR stream, 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		resolves all ads for the stream at that time. However, when the user starts to
		view content at a point after the beginning of the stream, you can decide
		whether to resolve only the ads that occur after the user’s current live point
		or to also resolve ads that occurred before the current live point. 
	 </p> 
	 <note type="tip">Resolving ads after the current live point is faster, but
		if the user seeks backwards, this option prevents the player from playing ads
		that appeared earlier.
