  <title>Customized logging</title> 
  <shortdesc>You can implement your own logging system. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>In addition to logging by using predefined notifications, you can
		implement a logging system that uses your log messages and messages that are
		generated by 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>.
		For more information about predefined notifications, see 
		<xref
		 href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/psdk/ios/index.html#PSDKs-concept-The_Notification_System"
		 format="html" scope="external">The Notification System</xref>. You can use
		these logs to troubleshoot your player applications and to provide better
		understanding of the playback and advertising workflow. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Customized logging uses a shared singleton instance of the 
		<codeph>PSDKPTLogFactory</codeph>, which provides a mechanism to log
		messages to multiple loggers. You define and add (register) one or more loggers
		to the 
		<codeph>PTLogFactory</codeph>. This allows you to define multiple loggers
		with custom implementations, such as a console logger, a web logger, or a
		console history logger. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><ph
		conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		generates log messages for many of its activities, which the 
		<codeph>PTLogFactory</codeph> forwards to all registered loggers. Your
		application can also generate custom log messages, which are forwarded to all
		registered loggers. Each logger can filter the messages and take appropriate
		action. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>There are two implementations for 
		<codeph>PTLogFactory</codeph>: 
	 <ul id="ul_4C5B92CDC9614209B233B4D1C8EA60B1"> 
		<li id="li_1815D2B441524F1B8B31EF3ACD6124C6">For listening to logs. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_2D557014E4D043F3A3BE543A17D965C6">For adding logs to a 
		  <codeph>PTLogFactory</codeph>. 
		</li> 
	 </ul>
