# Customized logging

In addition to logging by using predefined notifications, you can implement a logging system that uses your log messages and messages that are generated by . For more information about predefined notifications, see [The Notification System](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/psdk/ios/index.html#PSDKs-concept-The_Notification_System). You can use these logs to troubleshoot your player applications and to provide better understanding of the playback and advertising workflow.

Customized logging uses a shared singleton instance of the `codeph PSDKPTLogFactory`, which provides a mechanism to log messages to multiple loggers. You define and add (register) one or more loggers to the `codeph PTLogFactory`. This allows you to define multiple loggers with custom implementations, such as a console logger, a web logger, or a console history logger.

generates log messages for many of its activities, which the `codeph PTLogFactory` forwards to all registered loggers. Your application can also generate custom log messages, which are forwarded to all registered loggers. Each logger can filter the messages and take appropriate action.

There are two implementations for `codeph PTLogFactory`:
* For listening to logs.
* For adding logs to a `codeph PTLogFactory`.
