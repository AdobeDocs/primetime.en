		<title>Considerations</title> 
		<p>Remember the following information when using <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>: <ul
					id="ul_3245D84ED68A40789A5DA47F8A5E7A1A">
					<li id="li_4A1190C59F2D4BCBB48B862944BB0AF7">Adobe Primetime does not work on
						iOS simulators. <p>You must use real devices for testing. </p>
					</li>
					<li id="li_0BD237F0B4D84860AF192B6E9225B826">Playback is supported only for HTTP
						Live Streaming (HLS) content. </li>
					<li id="li_354B8A19BB024C8C88F55BEE2CCC1CB3">Main video content can be
						multiplexed, where video and audio streams are in the same rendition, or
						nonmultiplexed, where video and audio streams are in separate renditions. </li>
					<li id="li_E69C9AD9C83447CE8E93B7AAA7136171">The <ph
							conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> API is implemented in
						Objective-C. </li>
					<li id="li_805DF17DEFC44DBD83FE73B917DB6001">Video playback requires the native
						Apple AV Foundation framework. This affects how and when media resources,
						including closed captions and timelines, can be accessed: <ul
							id="ul_986B2D48E3684E3E8368D880719B574D">
							<li id="li_46D3B8B9533B4EDD96DC6A728BF4CBB7">Timeline adjustments cannot
								be revised after the initial setup. <p>For example, an advertisement
									cannot be removed from the timeline after it has played. If the
									user seeks back in the presentation, the same ad plays again
									even if the policy would have been to remove the ad. </p></li>
							<li id="c_">Depending on encoder precision, the actual encoded media
								duration might differ from the durations that are recorded in the
								stream resource manifest. <p>There is no reliable way to
									resynchronize between the ideal virtual timeline and the actual
									playout timeline. Progress tracking of the stream playback for
									ad management and Video Analytics must use the actual playout
									time, so reporting and user interface behavior might not
									precisely track the media and advertisement content. </p></li>
							<li id="li_1BA45D7E969E4730BCA90DA436CB027C">The incoming user agent for
								all HTTP requests from <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>
								on this platform is determined by the device and the iOS version
								that is running on the device. <p>The value of the user agent string
									defaults to what the operating system assigns. </p></li>

		<title>Best practices</title> 
		<p>Here are recommended practices for <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>: <ul

					<li id="li_CB85C38C36284467B18D1F367211DBDA">Use HLS version 3.0 or above for
						program content. </li>
					<li id="li_40220C8E18704A569CE1B5E5CD2BE5EA">Use Appleâ€™s mediastreamvalidator
						tool to validate VOD streams. </li>
					<li id="li_EFE49B607AFA453ABCD0B8CABF955446">The <codeph>PTSDKConfig</codeph>

							the <codeph>forceHTTPS</codeph> and <codeph>isForcingHTTPS</codeph>

						<note type="important">Requests to third-party domains such as Ad Tracking
