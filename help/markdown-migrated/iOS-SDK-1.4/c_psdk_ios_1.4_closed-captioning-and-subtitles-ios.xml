  <title>Subtitles and closed captioning</title> 
  <shortdesc> Closed captions and subtitles have some unique differences, and
	 you enable them in different ways. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Subtitle streams run in parallel with the main content. Closed captions
		are part of the data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams. 
	 </p>
	 <p>You should be aware of the following requirements for closed captions
		and subtitles:
	 <ul id="ul_32A3BCA3306744998E7CE6BCAF4E10F9">
		<li id="li_21EDFC1EF3264982B3A76066385B32F1"><b>Closed captions</b>
		  <ul id="ul_B8AB7C790A2D4DB1A2EEB106456F4B90"> 
			 <li id="li_FA24D19B528C49C4ACAA86E9651F64E2">Closed captions are
				typically in the same language as the audio and also represent background
				sounds as text. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_22EBCAB00A8D4D758D7F9DD8636FD6CC">Closed captions are part
				of the data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams in the video transmission
				stream. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_32F4710745A54883AE5170B5B09823BA">Closed captions are
				supported to the extent provided by the AV Foundation framework. 
			 </li>

			 <li id="li_5EC0D4069AC04F2BB7FD3C2F0511C88B">Subtitles are in streams
				that run in parallel with the main content.
				<p> The 
				  <codeph>PTMediaPlayer</codeph> plays the main content and ads,
				  where the main content could be live/linear or VOD, and ads could be pre-roll,
				  mid-roll, or post-roll. 
				</p>
			 </li> 
		  </ul>
		  <p>Here are some additional requirements for subtitles in iOS: 
		  <ul id="ul_u4g_yk4_dm"> 
			 <li id="li_C183E2ABD6FA4E6E9BF0B0FB5899FF0A">For timestamps, the 
				<codeph>X-TIMESTAMP-MAP</codeph> value, which is specified in the
				header section of the 
				<codeph>WebVTT</codeph> file, must match the video timestamp. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_27386B85B91F4EFBA9E8E2F637FCBD52">For the system, you must
				use iOS 6.1 or later. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		  </p>
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 </p> 
	 <note type="important">The requirements for subtitles do not apply to
		closed captions.
