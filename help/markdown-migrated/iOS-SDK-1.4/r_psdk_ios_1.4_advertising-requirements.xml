		<p>To incorporate ads in your video content, ensure that the advertising
		  and main video content meets the following requirements:

		<ul id="ul_26CD8E0A639645F88324E4FF0600E759"> 
		  <li id="li_BC0355419A69458EB8211ECBC6820D5F">The advertising content's
			 HLS version cannot be higher than the main content's HLS version. 
		  </li> 
		  <li  id="li_CC6A33346C6F417297F6A074D0825D92">Ads must be
			 multiplexed and must contain an audio-only rendition, regardless of whether the
			 main content is multiplexed. 
		  </li> 
		  <li  id="li_55BD88F2D8CF44C1B0BBB9885117C228">Ad
			 playlists should have the same bit-rate renditions as the renditions in the
			 main content playlist. 
		  </li> 
		  <li  id="li_8109EFC293AF440BA9826D7DF16635BB">The target
			 duration and individual fragment duration of an ad cannot exceed the target
			 duration of the main content. 
		  </li> 
		  <li  id="li_233FB030358E4E30B37C8CAB7B85CB65">If the main
			 content contains an audio-only stream, the advertising content must also
			 contain an audio-only stream. 
		  </li> 
		  <li  id="li_80BD70A6E4C94E07AA72425310A88A8C">If the main

		  </li> 
		  <li  id="li_475FDE5A34A8427D9AC71940C0587057">If the main
			 content is multiple bit rate (MBR), the advertising content must also be MBR.

		  <li id="li_2805194359424C938C882BCD9957A70D">If the main content has alternate audio tracks,
					each ad must have at least one audio-only stream. <p>If the ad does not have at
						least one audio-only stream, the ad is skipped. </p></li>
