  <title>Default and customized playback behavior with ads</title> 
  <shortdesc>The behavior of media playback is affected by seeking, pausing, and the inclusion of
		advertising. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>To override the default behavior, use <codeph>PTAdPolicySelector</codeph>. </p>
	 <note  type="important">For VOD and live/linear streaming,
		timeline adjustments cannot be revised. This means that an advertisement cannot
		be removed from the timeline after it has played. If the user seeks back, the
		same ad plays again even if the normal policy would have been to remove it. 
	 </note> 
	 <p> 
		<note type="important"> 
		  <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> does not provide a way to
		  disable seeking during ads. Adobe recommends that you configure your
		  application to disable seeking during ads.
