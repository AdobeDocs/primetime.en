  <title>Failover</title> 
  <shortdesc> Failover handling occurs when a variant playlist has multiple
	 renditions for the same bit rate, and one of the renditions stops working. The 
	 <ph
	  conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"></ph>
	 switches between renditions. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>The following example shows a variant playlist with failover URLs of the
		same bit rate: 
		<codeblock>#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1, BANDWIDTH =700000
http://sj2slu225.corp.adobe.com:8090/_default_/_default_/livestream.m3u8   

#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1, BANDWIDTH =700000
http://sj2slu225.corp.adobe.com:8091/_default_/_default_/livestream.m3u8</codeblock> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>When 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		loads the variant playlist, it creates a queue that holds the URLs for all the
		renditions of the content for the same bit rate. When a request for a URL
		fails, 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		uses the next URL of the same bit rate from the failover queue. At any specific
		failure time, 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		cycles once through all available URLs until it finds one that works correctly
		or until it has attempted all the available URLs. If 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		has tried to all of the available URLs and none of the URLs work, 
		<ph
		 conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
		stops trying to play the content. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Failover occurs only at the M3U8 level, which means: 
	 <ul id="ul_amq_jjd_2m"> 
		<li id="li_5B931D72E02E44C1AD493B3F787A5EFD">For VOD, failover can occur
		  only when it begins to attempt to play and not after it has started playing. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_40D7EF4E85DC4246B0D642AB3E73EDAF">For live streaming, failover
		  can happen in the middle of the stream. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <note type="tip"><ph
		conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>,
		rather than the Apple AV Foundation player, provides failover handling.
