  <title>About the MediaPlayerItem class</title> 
  <shortdesc><ph>After a media resource is successfully loaded, <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> creates an instance of the
				<codeph>PTMediaPlayerItem</codeph> class to provide access to that resource.</ph>
	</shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>The <codeph>PTMediaPlayer</codeph> resolves the media resource, loads the associated manifest
			file, and parses the manifest. This is the asynchronous part of the resource loading
			process. The <codeph>PTMediaPlayerItem</codeph> instance is produced after the resource
			has been resolved, and this instance is a resolved version of a media resource. <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> provides access to the newly created
				<codeph>PTMediaPlayerItem</codeph> instance through
				<codeph>PTMediaPlayer.currentItem</codeph>. </p>
	 <note type="tip">You must wait for the resource to be successfully loaded
		before accessing the media player item.
