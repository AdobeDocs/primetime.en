# Live and linear ad resolving and insertion

supports the following live and linear use cases:
* Pre-roll ad insertion, where at least one ad is inserted at the beginning of the content.
* Mid-roll ad insertion, where at least one ad is inserted in the middle of the content.

resolves the ads and inserts the ads when a cue point is encountered in the live or linear stream. By default,  supports the following cues as valid ad markers when resolving and placing ads:
* #EXT-X-CUEPOINT
* #EXT-X-AD
* #EXT-X-CUE
* #EXT-X-CUE-OUT

These markers require the metadata field's `codeph DURATION` in seconds and the cueâ€™s unique ID. For example:
```
#EXT-X-CUE DURATION=27 ID=identiferForThisCue ...

```
