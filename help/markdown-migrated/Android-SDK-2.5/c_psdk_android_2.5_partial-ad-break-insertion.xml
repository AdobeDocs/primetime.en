  <title>Partial Ad break insertion</title> 
  <shortdesc> 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>You can enable a TV-like experience of being able to join in the middle
		of an ad, in live streams. The Partial Ad break feature allows you to mimic a
		TV-like experience where, if the client starts a live stream inside a midroll,
		it will start within that midroll. It is similar to switching to a TV channel
		and the commercials run seamlessly.
	 </p>
	 <p>For example, If a user joins in the middle of a 90-second ad break
		(three 30-second ads), 10 seconds into the second ad (that is, at 40 seconds
		into the ad break), the following happens:
	 <ul id="ul_75B851FD394A4730A588174FF414DD67">
		<li id="li_ED9FCA93697440A791C4C48860D3AE82">The second ad is played for
		  the remaining duration (20 sec) followed by the third ad.
		</li>
		<li id="li_FBD4DA8D35ED4936AD63188931776EBD">Ad trackers for the
		  partially played ad (the second ad) are not fired. Only the tracker for the
		  third ad is fired.
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 </p>
	 <p>This behavior is not enabled by default. To enable this feature work in
		your app, do the following:
	 <ol id="ol_ED08512F09994F1EA0255950E4092CB4">
		<li id="li_EE711518EADA423B8237C2EA717ED9CA">Disable the live prerolls,
		  using AdvertisingMetadata class's method setEnableLivePreroll.
		  <codeblock>advertisingMetadata.setLivePreroll(false) 
advertisingMetadata.setPreroll(false)</codeblock>
		</li>
		<li id="li_B6ABBEBB9D44481AAFDE4CA2F2D5D2B0"> Switch ON the preference
		  for Partial Ad-break Insertion. Use the new method setPartialAdBreakPref in
		  MediaPlayer interface to switch this feature ON. Use getPartialAdBreakPref
		  method to find the current state of this preference.
		  <codeblock>MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(getActivity().getApplicationContext());
	mediaPlayer.setPartialAdBreakPref(true);</codeblock>
		</li>
	 </ol>
	 </p>
