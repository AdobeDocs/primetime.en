  <title>VOD ad resolving and insertion</title> 
  <shortdesc>For video-on-demand (VOD) content, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> inserts ad breaks by
	 splicing the ads in the main content so that the timeline duration increases. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Before playback, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> resolves known ads, inserts ad breaks in the main
		content as described by a timeline that is returned from 
		<ph conkeyref="phrases/auditude-name-long"/>, and recomputes the virtual
		timeline, if necessary. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> inserts ads in the following ways: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_59BB6CCCF5DD4CA38EB4DE54ABB3528C"> 
		<li id="li_B98B103FE9994475A4853A14EAEED774"><b>Pre-roll</b>, which is
		  placed before the content. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_B5B80BFF324045BD972444636679D54E"><b>Mid-roll</b>, which is in
		  the middle of the content. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_ABA048242CC14815BBF4A1ACF5034C92"><b>Post-roll</b>, which is
		  placed after the content. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <note type="tip">After playback starts, no additional changes can occur in
		the content. 
	 </note> 
	 <p>Ads cannot be: 
	 <ul id="ul_7CE6DFE2F1954B1A88E3FE96F0A2D513"> 
		<li id="li_7FEC6C240A6D41878E7FC7913040A2E8">Inserted 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_27DCE5BF83F54874B95A7B816B305F0B">Deleted 
		  <p>For example, you cannot delete built-in ads from the content to
			 offer an ad-free experience. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_CC732F61AA254CE5BEC3B0EF1A6E0153">Replaced 
		  <p>For example, you cannot replace built-in ads with targeted ads. 
		  </p> 
		</li>
