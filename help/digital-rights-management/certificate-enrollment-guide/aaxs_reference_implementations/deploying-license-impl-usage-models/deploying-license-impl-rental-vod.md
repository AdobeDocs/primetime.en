# Rental/Video-On-Demand{#rental-video-on-demand}

With the Video-On-Demand (VOD) usage model, content is offered with time-based restrictions. For example, a user has the option to play the content during a 30-day period; however, once playback begins, the user has up to 48 hours to finish watching, after which time the content will no longer be playable. When requesting a license, the user must authenticate so the server can verify that the user has a rental account.
