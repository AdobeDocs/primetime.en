# Installing the command line tools{#installing-the-command-line-tools}

You can copy the files you need from the [!DNL \Reference Implementation\Command Line Tools] directory on the DVD, which contains the default [!DNL flashaccesstools.properties] configuration file, and a [!DNL libs] directory, which contains the JAR files for the tools.

The [!DNL samples] directory contains several sample Java source files demonstrating usage of the Adobe Access SDK APIs. To build and run the samples, use the [!DNL build-samples.xml] Ant script.
