# DRM Client Error Message Reference {#client-error-message-reference}

The DRM Client errors are a subset of the TVSDK client-side errors, with the DRM-related errors codes ranging from 3300 to 3399.

| Error Code | Mnemonic | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| 3300 | Invalid Voucher | What the distributor's software should do: <ul><li> If you are using Google Chrome, and you are in Incognito mode, and your Flash Player version is lower than 11.6, this error might occur. We recommend that the player check the browser's version number and advise the user to exit Incognito mode.</li><li> Request the license again. If the request is successful, you do not need to log or escalate. If the request is unsuccessful, log the content that caused the error. `subErrorId` contains a line error if present.</li></ul> What the distributor should do: <ul><li> If retries are unsuccessful on configurations other than Chrome with Flash less than version 11.6, a failure might have occurred in the packaging.</li><li>Check whether the issue is specific to certain content and repackage.</li></ul>|
|3301 | Authentication Failed | The server failed to authenticate or authorize the client.<ul><li>The distributor’s software should take any action necessary to re-establish the user’s credentials or guide the user to acquire access to the content.</li><li>The distributor should confirm that its authorization and authentication mechanism is working correctly. If the distributors are not planning to use the authentication or authorization features, they should check whether the policy of the offending content requires authentication, and see Diagnosing policy / license discrepancies.</li></ul> For more information about this error code, see [DRM Error 3301 causes and resolution](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1277149).|
| 3302 | RequireSSL | For Primetime DRM 4.0 and above, this error is thrown on iOS when the remote key URL does not use HTTPS as the scheme. HTTPS is required. <ul><li>If distributor is using a version older than Primetime DRM version 4, or at least version 4 but the platform is not iOS, the distributor's software should log the error. This error is thrown only on iOS.</li><li>If the distributor's software is at least Primetime DRM version 4, and the platform is iOS, distributors must change the remote key server URL that they are using to HTTPS. If they were only using HTTP, distributors might have to set up an HTTPS server. Otherwise, the distributors need to submit the logged information to Adobe and escalate the issue.</li></ul>|
| 3303 | ContentExpired | The content you are viewing has expired according to the rules set by the content provider.  `subErrorId` contains a client-specific error or line error. <ul><li>The distributor's software should attempt to reacquire a license from the server once to determine whether a new non-expired license is available. If no license is available or the license has expired, allow the user to acquire a new license, or inform the user that the content cannot be watched.</li></ul> If the content has been packaged with a policy that has a lapsed expiration/end date, and the license server logs report a PolicyEvaluationException, state that the Policy End Date has lapsed (Server Error code 303). Check the server's log files to verify.<br>If possible, customers should check the policy that they used during packaging to see whether it has expired. The Java command line tool is: <ul><li>java -jar libs/AdobePolicyManager.jar</li><li> detail demo.pol</li><li>The distributor should confirm whether license expiration dates are configured as intended.</li></ul> For more information about this error code, see [3303 (Content Expired) with AMS/FMS using a Live Stream?](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1300813)|
| 3304 | AuthorizationFailed | The current user is not authorized to view content. Login as a different user.<br>For more information about this error code, see Error code 3301.|
| 3305 | ServerConnectionFailed | The connection to the license or domain servers timed out, either due to network delay or the client being offline. NormallysubErrorId contains the HTTP return code.<ul><li>The distributor's software should attempt a network connection to a known good server. If the attempt fails, prompt the user to reconnect to the network. If the attempt is successful, log it.</li><li>The distributor should verify that any license and domain servers in use are online and visible from the client's network.</li></ul>For more information about this error code, see [DRM 3305 ServerConnectionFailed causes and resolution](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1284947.)|
| 3307 | InternalFailure | This generally represents a bug in Primetime DRM code and is unexpected, unless there's a known bug, as below.subErrorId contains a client-specific error or line error.<ul><li>If the browser is Chrome on Windows and Flash version is 11.6 (SWF version 19 or greater), the distributor's software should assume that the user pressed Deny on the infobar and treat the same as a 3368.</li><li>If 3307 occurs when browser is not Chrome or Flash version is not 11.6, the distributor should escalate to Adobe.</li></ul>**Note:** 3307:1107296344 (FailedToGetBrokerHandle) might happen with Chrome browser versions 24-28.|
| 3308 | WrongLicenseKey | This error is thrown whenever the license being used contains the wrong key to decrypt the content. The subErrorIdcontains a client-specific error or line error.<br>There seems to be only two ways of generating this error:<ul><li>The customer has modified the standard Adobe tooling for generating licenses (for example, the licenser server Java framework). In this case, the license contains a bad key which might not correspond to any content.</li><li>The customer has issued multiple licenses with the same license ID. In this case, there are multiple licenses that are available on the client that match the content metadata and the Primetime DRM code has selected the wrong one for use.</li><li>The distributor's software should attempt to reacquire the license from the server.</li><li>If no license is available or the license is expired, provide a workflow for the user to acquire a new license, or inform the user that the content cannot be watched, and log the issue.</li><li>If this was a domain bound content (for AIR), provide a way for the user to join the domain.</li><li>The distributor should:</li><li>Verify that they have not customized the license issuance portions of thePrimetime DRM License server.</li><li>Verify that they are issuing unique license IDs for all licenses.</li><li>Escalate the issue with Adobe.</li></ul>|
