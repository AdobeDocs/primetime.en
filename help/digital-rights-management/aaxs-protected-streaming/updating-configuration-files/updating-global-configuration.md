# Updating the Global Configuration File{#updating-the-global-configuration-file}

The HSM password in [!DNL flashaccess-global.xml] can be modified at any time, and the changes take effect the next time the server reloads the configuration file. However, changes to the "Logging" and "Caching" elements are not reloaded; any changes in these elements require a server restart.
