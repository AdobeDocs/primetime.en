# About Adobe Access Server for Protected Streaming{#about-adobe-access-server-for-protected-streaming}

The Adobe® Access™ Server for Protected Streaming is a license server implementation based on the Adobe Access SDK. This server issues licenses for protected content to Adobe Access clients.

The Adobe Access Server for Protected Streaming supports multiple tenants, meaning a single server can be hosted on behalf of multiple content publishers, each with its own configuration settings. In addition, the server supports custom authorization components, so custom logic can be executed before issuing a license.

This server is intended for use with HTTP Streaming. As a result, this server implementation does not support all of the capabilities available in Adobe Access. For example, the Adobe Access Server for Protected Streaming does not support user authentication requests, multiple policies, domain-bound licenses, license chaining, or synchronization messages.
