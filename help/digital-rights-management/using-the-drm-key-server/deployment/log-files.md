# Log files{#log-files}

The log files generated by the Primetime DRM Key Server application ( [!DNL flashaccess-ioskeyserver_*.log] and [!DNL flashaccess-xboxkeyserver_*.log]) will be located in the directory specified by `KeyServer.LogRoot`.

The log files are distinguished by client type. There are two logs per client type:

* An *access log* - Monitors requests and responses only. 
* A *context log* - Contains detailed error messages and stack traces.
