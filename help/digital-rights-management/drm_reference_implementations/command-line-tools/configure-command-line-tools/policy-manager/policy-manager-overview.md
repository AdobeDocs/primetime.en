Use the Primetime DRM Policy Manager command-line tool ( [!DNL AdobePolicyManager.jar]) to create and manage DRM policies.

Before you run [!DNL AdobePolicyManager.jar], you must set properties in the Policy Manager Properties section of your configuration file. The values you set in the configuration file are applied to all DRM policies. 

>[!NOTE]

>You can also specify all Policy Manager properties from the command line.
