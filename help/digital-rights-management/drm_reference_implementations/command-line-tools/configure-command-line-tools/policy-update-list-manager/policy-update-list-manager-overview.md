Use the Primetime DRM Policy Update List Manager command-line tool ( [!DNL AdobePolicyUpdateListManager.jar]) to create and manage DRM policy update lists, and to check whether policies have been updated or revoked.

Before you run the Policy Update List Manager command-line tool, you must set properties in the *Policy Update List Manager and Revocation List Manager Properties* section of your configuration file.

>You can also specify all Policy Update List Manager properties from the command line.
