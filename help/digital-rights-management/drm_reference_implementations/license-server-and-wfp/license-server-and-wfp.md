# License server{#license-server}

The reference implementation server can help you create a fully functional license server that uses all of the features of the Adobe Primetime DRM Java SDK.

In this implementation, users are authenticated based on user entries in a database. The server includes demonstration business logic for issuing licenses and provides compatibility support for Flash Media Rights Management Server 1.0 and 1.5.
