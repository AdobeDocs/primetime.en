# Java APIs for protecting content{#java-apis-for-protecting-content}

These APIs are used to define rights and prepare content for distribution. The content protection APIs are:

* Policy management

  The policy management API is used to create and modify policies to be applied to content. Policies can be created or updated, including getting/setting all usage rules and allowing additional parameters in a custom namespace. 

* Content packaging

  The content packaging API is used to encrypt content and retrieve metadata from the packaged content.
