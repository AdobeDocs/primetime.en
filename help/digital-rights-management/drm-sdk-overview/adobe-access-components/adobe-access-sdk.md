# Overview {#drm-components-overview}

The main components of Primetime DRM consist of a Java SDK, and the Flash Player and Adobe AIR client runtime environments.

For more information on setting up the SDK, see Setting up the SDK in *Using the Adobe Primetime DRM SDK for Protecting Content.*

The Primetime DRM SDK lets you develop a digital rights management solution that integrates with your organization's existing business infrastructure, such as content management, billing, and user access control systems. Flash Player and Adobe AIR let you create and easily deploy applications through which consumers can access and view large libraries of digital content.
