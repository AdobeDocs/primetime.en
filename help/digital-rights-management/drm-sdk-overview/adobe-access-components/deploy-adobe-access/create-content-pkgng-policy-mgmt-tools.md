# Create content packaging and policy management tools{#create-content-packaging-and-policy-management-tools}

Using the Adobe Primetime DRM SDK, you can create content packaging and policy management tools. The policy management APIs allow administrators to create, view details of, and update policies. The packaging APIs embed the policy into video file, and encrypt the file using the content encryption key.

The Primetime DRM SDK includes a reference implementation ( [!DNL AdobePackager.jar]) that provides examples of content packaging and policy management tools ( [!DNL AdobePolicyManager.jar]).

To learn more about creating content packaging and policy management tools, see *Using the Adobe Primetime DRM SDK For Protecting Content*.
