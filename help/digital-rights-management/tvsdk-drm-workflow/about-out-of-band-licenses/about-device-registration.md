# About device registration{#about-device-registration}

All Primetime DRM licenses, at creation time, must be bound to an end-entity. Binding is the cryptographic process of only allowing a specific entity the ability to consume the license. This is necessary as to prevent "floating licenses" which can be used by any arbitrary device. For Primetime DRM to "pre-generate" licenses, this means the "target" of these pre-generated licenses must be known ahead of time. Primetime DRM refers to this as "Device Registration".
