# About Adobe Primetime DRM credentials{#about-adobe-primetime-drm-credentials}

If you want to issue valid licenses that a Primetime DRM client can accpt, then you must configure the Primetime DRM Server for Protected Streaming with a set of credentials that Adobe has issued. You can store these credentials in PKCS#12 (.pfx) files or on an HSM.

The [!DNL .pfx] files can be located in any directory that you select. However, Adobe recommends that you locate the [!DNL .pfx] files in the tenant's configuration directory for ease of access.
