# Secure the server {#secure-the-server}

You need to physically secure the computer on which policy management and content packaging occurs. (See [Physical security and access](../../aaxs-secure-deployment-guidelines/physical-sec-and-access.md).)

In addition, if your content packaging implementation requires network connectivity, you must harden your operating system and implement an appropriate firewall solution. For information, see [Network topology](../../aaxs-secure-deployment-guidelines/overview/network-topology.md).
