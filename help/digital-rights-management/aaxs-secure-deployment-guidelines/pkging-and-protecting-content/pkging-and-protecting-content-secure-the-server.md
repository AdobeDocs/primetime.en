# Secure the server{#secure-the-server}

You need to physically secure the computer on which policy management and content packaging occurs. (See [Physical security and access](c-aaxs-xgep-sdg-physical-sec-and-access).)

In addition, if your content packaging implementation requires network connectivity, you must harden your operating system and implement an appropriate firewall solution. For information, see [Network topology](networkTopology.md#WS287f927bd30d4b1f-1bb44af913073c96153-8000-ver2.0).
