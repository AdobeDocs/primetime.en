All authentication tokens generated by the Adobe Access SDK have a timeout interval to protect application security. The expiration for the authentication token is specified use the Adobe Access SDK when handling an authentication request. Once the expiration has passed, the authentication token is no longer valid and the user must re-authenticate with the license server.

To learn more about authentication requests, see AuthenticationHandler in the *Adobe Access API Reference*.
