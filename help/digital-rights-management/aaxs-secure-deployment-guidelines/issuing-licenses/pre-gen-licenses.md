# Pre-generating licenses{#pre-generating-licenses}

If you are pre-generating licenses that contain time-based usage rules, it is highly recommended that the license includes synchronization requirements (See *Using the Adobe Access SDK for Protecting Content* guide), so the license expiration can be enforced securely. Implementing a â€˜heart beat' mechanism between the client and the server is highly recommended if you have any time-based restrictions in the license, since the heart beat will synchronize the client time with the server time.
