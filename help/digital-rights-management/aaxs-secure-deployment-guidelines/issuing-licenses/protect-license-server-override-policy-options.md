# Overriding policy options{#overriding-policy-options}

When issuing a license, it is possible for the license server to override the usage rules specified in the policy. If the policy specifies a start date, a license is not generated before that start date. However, it is possible to set a future start date in the license after the license is generated. This option should be used with caution, as the client will not prevent the user from moving the system time forward to circumvent the start date.
