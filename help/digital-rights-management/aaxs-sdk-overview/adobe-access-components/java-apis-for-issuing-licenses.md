# Java APIs for issuing licenses {#java-apis-for-issuing-licenses}

These APIs are used when a client requests a license from the server. The SDK supports the following requests from the client:

* Authentication

  The authentication API can be used to handle authentication requests and generate authentication tokens. 

* License generation and acquisition

  The license generation and acquisition API is used to generate a license for the user. 

* Support for Adobe AIR version 1.5 clients and content

  For the purposes of backwards compatibility, the SDK has APIs to handle requests from AIR applications created for use with AIR version 1.5 and earlier clients and protected content.
