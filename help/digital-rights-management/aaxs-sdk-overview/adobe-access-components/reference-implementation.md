The SDK includes a reference implementation, a simple Adobe Access deployment that demonstrates how to use the Java APIs. The reference implementation provides a License Server, Watched Folder Packager, Adobe Access Manager AIR application, and command line tools for content packaging and policy management based on the Java APIs.
