# Implement a License Server {#implement-a-license-server}

Using Adobe Access SDK, you must create a License Server. When content is protected using Adobe Access, it cannot be viewed until a license is issued to the consumer by the License Server. If identity-based licensing is used, password-based authentication ensures that only authorized consumers can open and view content.

When implementing a License Server, you must obtain the necessary digital certificates from Adobe. Refer to the Adobe Access Certificate Enrollment document for detailed instructions on requesting certificates.

To learn more about implementing a License Server, and obtaining digital certificates, see* Using Adobe Access SDK for Protecting Content.*
