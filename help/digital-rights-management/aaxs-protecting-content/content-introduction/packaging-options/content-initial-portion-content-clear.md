# Initial portion of content in the clear{#initial-portion-of-content-in-the-clear}

Specifies an optional amount of time, in seconds, that the beginning of the content is left in the clear (meaning it is not encrypted).

Example use case: Allows for faster time to playback while the Adobe Access client downloads the license in the background. The unencrypted portion of the video begins playback immediately, while the Adobe Access initialization and license acquisition occur behind the scenes. With this feature turned off, users may notice a delay in playback experience, as the client machine is performing all of the licensing steps before any video playback occurs.
