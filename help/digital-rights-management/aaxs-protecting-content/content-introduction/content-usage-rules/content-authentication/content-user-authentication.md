# User authentication {#user-authentication}

Specifies whether a credential, such as username and password, is required to acquire a license. If authenticated (identity-based) licensing is specified, the server authenticates the user before issuing a license.

**Example use case:** A subscription service might require a username/password to be entered before issuing a content license. A DVD or Blu-ray disc with Digital Copy might provide a code or other token as proof of payment, which can be redeemed for an electronic download.
