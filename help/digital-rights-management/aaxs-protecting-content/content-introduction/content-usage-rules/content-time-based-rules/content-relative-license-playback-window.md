# Playback window{#playback-window}

Specifies the duration a license is valid after the first time it is used to play protected content.

Example use case: Some business models allow a rental period of 30 days but, once playback begins, it must be completed in 48 hours. This 48-hour longevity of the license is defined as the playback window.
