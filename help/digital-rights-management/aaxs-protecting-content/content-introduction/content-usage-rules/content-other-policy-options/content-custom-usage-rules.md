# Custom usage rules{#custom-usage-rules}

Specifies custom usage rules. Custom data can be included in licenses issued by the License Server. The interpretation/handling of this data is completely up to the implementation of the client application and license server.

Example use case: Enables extensibility of usage rules by allowing other business rules to be conveyed securely as part of the policy and/or content license. For security reasons, because these usage rules are enforced in custom client application code, this option should be used in conjunction with the AIR application or Flash Player SWF white-list options. For more information, see “ [Runtime and application restrictions](../../../../aaxs-protecting-content/content-introduction/content-usage-rules/content-runtime-application-restrictions/content-runtime-application-restrictions.md)”.
