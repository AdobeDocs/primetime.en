Using Adobe Access Professional, it is possible to pre-generate licenses and embed licenses in content. This feature can be combined with the Enhanced License Chaining such that a Leaf license is pre-generated and embedded in the content, and the client can request a Root license (bound to a machine or domain) from a license server. Alternatively, client applications can implement a workflow where the device pre-registers with a server, the server pre-generates licenses bound to that device, and the client retrieves its licenses from a simple HTTP web server.
