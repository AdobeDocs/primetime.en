# Policy update lists{#policy-update-lists}

If you update the usage rules in a policy after packaging the content, the license server needs to have the latest version in order to issue licenses using the updated policy. One way to achieve this is through a policy update list. A policy update list is a file containing a list of updated or revoked policies. When a policy is updated, generate a new Policy Update List and periodically push the list out to all the license servers.

For more information creating and updating policies, see * [Working with policies](../../aaxs-protecting-content/content-working-with-policies/content-working-with-policies.md)*.
