# Securing the server{#securing-the-server}

You need to physically secure the computer on which policy management and content packaging occurs.

For more information, see [Physical security and access](../../secure-deployment-guidelines/physical-sec-and-access.md).

If your content packaging implementation requires network connectivity, you must harden your operating system and implement an appropriate firewall solution. For more information, see [Network topology](../../secure-deployment-guidelines/overview/network-topology.md).
