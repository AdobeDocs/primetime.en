# Securely storing policies{#securely-storing-policies}

The Adobe Primetime DRM SDK allows you to develop applications that can be used in content packaging and policy creation.

When you create these applications, you can allow some users to create and modify policies, and limit other users to only applying existing policies to the content. You must implement the necessary access controls and create user accounts with different privileges for policy creation and policy application.

Policies are not signed or protected from modification until they are used in packaging. If you are concerned that packaging tool users might modify policies, sign the policies to ensure that the policies cannot be modified.

For more information about creating applications with the SDK, see the Primetime DRM APIs on [API Primetime API References](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/index.html#api-Adobe_Primetime_API_References).
