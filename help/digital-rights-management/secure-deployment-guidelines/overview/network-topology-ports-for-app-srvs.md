# Ports for application servers{#ports-for-application-servers}

You can configure the Adobe Primetime DRM license server to use any network port.

These ports must be enabled or disabled on the inner firewall, depending on the network functionality that you want to allow for clients that connect to the application server that runs Primetime DRM.
