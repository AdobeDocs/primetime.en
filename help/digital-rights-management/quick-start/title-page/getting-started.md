# Getting Started{#getting-started}

This document provides the steps for a quick setup and deployment of an Adobe Primetime DRM ecosystem that uses Progressive Download to distribute content, and the Primetime DRM Server for Protected Streaming for license distribution. Additional details on each step is provided in the following guides:

* *Using the Primetime DRM Server for Protecting Content* 
* *Using the Primetime DRM Server for Protected Streaming*

The Primetime DRM Server for Protected Streaming is a minimal-functionality server that does not include source code. For a modifiable server with full Java source, see the *Using the Primetime DRM Reference Implementations* guide. If you set up up a Reference License server, that replaces the *Setup and deploy Primetime DRM Server for Protected Streaming (License Server)* step.
