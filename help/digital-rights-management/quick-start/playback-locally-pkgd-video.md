# Play back a locally packaged video{#play-back-a-locally-packaged-video}

1. To open a player, enter the following URL in a browser:

   ```
   http://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/AccessPlayer/player.html
   ```

1. Enter your locally packaged content URL in the player's media URL field and play it.
If your locally packaged content is not reachable from the Internet, you can download an Adobe sample video player (AccessPlayer) from [http://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/AccessPlayer.zip](http://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/AccessPlayer.zip), and place it on your local web server to use it.
