# Relative end date{#relative-end-date}

The relative end date specifies the license expiration date, which is expressed relative to the date of packaging, not relative to the date when the license was issued.

Example use case: In an automated packaging process, use a single Primetime DRM policy with this option for a series of videos, to set the expiration date to 30 days relative to the date of packaging.
