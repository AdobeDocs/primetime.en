# Minimum security level for DRM and runtimes{#minimum-security-level-for-drm-and-runtimes}

The minimum security level specifies the security level required to access content. You specify individual security levels for each component.

The default security level for DRM/Runtime modules is 10000.

Example use case: Certain types of content (for example HD video) might require a higher security level than other types.
