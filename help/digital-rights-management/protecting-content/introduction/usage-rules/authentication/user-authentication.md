# Usage rules {#usage-rules}

The following topics describe the usage rules that you can specify in an Adobe Primetime DRM policy.

## User authentication {#user-authentication}

User authentication specifies whether a credential, such as username and password, is required to acquire a license. If authenticated (identity-based) licensing is specified, the server ~~_authenticates_~~ the user before issuing a license.

Example use case: A subscription service might require a username and password to be entered before issuing a content license. A DVD or Blu-ray disc with Digital Copy might provide a code or other token as proof of payment, which can be redeemed for an electronic download.
