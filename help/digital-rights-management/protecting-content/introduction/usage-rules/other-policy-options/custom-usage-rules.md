# Custom usage rules {#custom-usage-rules}

You can include custom data in any licenses that the License Server issues. The interpretation or handling of this data is determined by the implementation of the client application and the license server.

Example use case: Enables extensibility of usage rules by allowing other business rules to be conveyed securely as part of the Primetime DRM policy and/or content license. For security reasons, because these usage rules are enforced in custom client application code, you should apply this option in conjunction with the allow list option for AIR applications or Flash Player SWFs.
