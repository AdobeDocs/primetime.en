# Encrypting script data{#encrypting-script-data}

This packaging option specifies whether script data embedded in the content is encrypted.

>[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}

>This rule only applies to FLV file format. Script data is always left in the clear for files in other formats.

Example use case: Use this option to leave script data unencrypted, which allows for metadata aggregation tools to read the metadata of protected content.
