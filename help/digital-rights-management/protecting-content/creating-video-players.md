# Create video players{#create-video-players}

If you want to play back protected content, your application must use the ActionScript 3 DRM APIs or Adobe Primetime DRM.

See the *Programming ActionScript 3* and the *ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform* for more information.

See the Adobe Primetime PSDK documentation on how to build iOS-based video players.
