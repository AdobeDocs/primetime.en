# Identity-based licenses{#identity-based-licenses}

If identity-based licensing is used, the server checks for a valid authentication token before issuing a license.

See [User authentication](../../../protecting-content/implementing-the-license-server/processing-drm-requests.md#user-authentication) for details on handling authentication tokens.
