# Setting policies for FairPlay{#setting-policies-for-fairplay}

You can set polices for FairPlay-protected content by using an entitlement server. You can set up your own, or make use of an Adobe-provided sample entitlement server.

Adobe provides a Sample ExpressPlay Entitlement Server (SEES) that shows how to do *time-based* and *device-binding* entitlement. This sample entitlement server is built on top of ExpressPlay services.

* [Reference Service: Device-Binding Entitlement](sees-reference-server-device-binding-entitlement.md)
