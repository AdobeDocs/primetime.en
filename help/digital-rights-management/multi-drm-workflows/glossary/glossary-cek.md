Content Encryption Key The content encryption key (CEK), generated by a utility, is subsequently used by a content packager in preparing content that must be protected. 
:    
:    
:    The utility generates the key in hex with a length of 16 bytes. 
:    
:    
:    This guide shows, in notes and error message, file, and command samples, the following variants of parameter names and value names for the CEK: 
:    
:    
:    
:    * content key 
:    * `&contentKey=` 
:    * `?cek=` 
:    * `<CEK>` 
:    * `[YOUR CONTENT KEY]` 
:    
:    
:    Filenames for a CEK are shown as: 
:    
:    
:    
:    * `keyfile.bin` 
:    * `creds/fairplaybin` 
:    * `Jaigo_DASH/_info/key.B64.random` 
:    
:    
:    The CEK itself can be stored in a key management system as well as encrypted. This guide refers to the storage index as the CEK Storage ID CEKSID. The term Key Encryption Key (KEK) refers to the second-level encryption key, and the term `ek` refers to the value of that encryption. 
:    
:    
:    Some calls use both the CEK and the CEK Storage ID CEKSID, and the CEK retrieved from storage must match the CEK provided in the call. 
:    
:    
:    For HLS Offline with FairPlay, there is also a `persistentContentKey` which can be set to expire.
