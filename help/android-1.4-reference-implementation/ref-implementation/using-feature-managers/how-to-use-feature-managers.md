# How to use feature managers {#how-to-use-feature-managers}

There are two ways of using the feature managers to enable, disable, and configure features:

* You can create and configure a feature manager by passing configuration information from a configuration file to the media player. 
* You can enable and disable features without going through the code by using the manager factory.
