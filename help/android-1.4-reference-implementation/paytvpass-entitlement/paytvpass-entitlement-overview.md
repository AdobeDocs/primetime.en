You can use Adobe Primetime authentication to manage user entitlement in your player.

The feature manager that encapsulates the Primetime authentication entitlement flows is the `EntitlementManager`. This class encapsulates the entitlement logic while delegating the UI work to elsewhere.

This Reference Implementation for Android uses the Primetime authentication AccessEnabler library version 1.7.3. Much of the implementation is very similar to the existing demo application provided with the AccessEnabler library.

For additional information on Primetime authentication, see the documentation at [Introduction to programmer integration](https://tve.helpdocsonline.com/introduction-to-programmer-integration).
