# Best practices for companion banner ads{#best-practices-for-companion-banner-ads}

When displaying companion ads, follow these recommendations:

* Attempt to present as many of a video ad's companion banner ads as will fit in your player's layout. 
* Present a companion banner only if you have a location that matches the ad's specified height and width.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >Do not resize the ad.

* Begin presenting the companion banner(s) as soon as possible after the ad begins. 
* Do not overlay the main ad/video container with companion banners. 
* You can display companion banners after the ad ends.

  The standard practice is to display each companion banner until you have a replacement for the ad.
