# Playback and failover

Primetime cannot protect from such failures as an ISP outage or a cable disconnection. However, Primetime streaming provides failover protection to protect playback from certain remote server failures or operational failures, making a better experience for viewers.  <!-- PH element: phrases/primetime-sdk-name --> implements failover protection to minimize playback interruptions and achieve a seamless playback despite transmission problems. The video player automatically switches to a backup media set when entire renditions or fragments are unavailable.
