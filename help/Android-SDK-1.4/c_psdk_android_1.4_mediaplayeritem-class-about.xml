  <title>About the MediaPlayerItem class</title> 
  <shortdesc>After a media resource is successfully loaded, <ph
			conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> creates an instance of the
			<codeph>MediaPlayerItem</codeph> class to provide access to that resource. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p >The 
		<codeph>MediaResource</codeph> represents a request that is issued by the
		application layer to the 
		<codeph>MediaPlayer</codeph> instance to load content. 
	 </p>
	 <p>The <codeph>MediaPlayer</codeph> resolves the media resource, loads the associated manifest
			file, and parses the manifest. This is the asynchronous part of the resource loading
			process. The <codeph>MediaPlayerItem</codeph> instance is produced after the resource
			has been resolved, and this instance is a resolved version of a
				<codeph>MediaResource</codeph>. <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/>
			provides access to the newly created <codeph>MediaPlayerItem</codeph> instance through
				<codeph>MediaPlayer.CurrentItem</codeph>
		</p>
	 <note type="tip">You must wait for the resource to be successfully loaded
		before accessing the media player item.
