  <title>Playback and failover</title> 
  <shortdesc><draft-comment author="kenny">This whole hierarchy of topics copied over from DHLS 2.3
			per Richa on Browser TVSDK team. Missing segment failover topic modified,
			renamed.</draft-comment>Streaming over the Internet requires a constant and stable
		connection to play a stream from a remote server. However, the variability of a viewer's
		Internet connection or streaming playback means that remote playback might not have the
		quality of media played locally. </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>Primetime cannot protect from such failures as an ISP outage
		or a cable disconnection. However, Primetime streaming provides failover
		protection to protect playback from certain remote server failures or
		operational failures, making a better experience for viewers. 
	 	<ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> implements failover protection 
	 	to minimize playback interruptions and achieve a seamless playback despite 
	 	transmission problems. The video player automatically switches to a backup media 
	 	set when entire renditions or fragments are unavailable.
