  <title>Buffering</title> 
  <shortdesc>To provide a smoother viewing experience, 
	 <ph
	  conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph>
	 sometimes buffers the video stream. 
	 <ph >You can configure the way the player
		buffers.</ph> 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p><ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"
				><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph> defines a playback buffer length of at least 30
			seconds and an initial buffer time within that, before the media starts playing, of at
			least 2 seconds. After the application calls <codeph>play</codeph> but before playback
			begins, <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"
				><?xm-replace_text Phrase?></ph> buffers the media up to the initial time to give a
			smooth start when it actually starts playing. </p> 
	 <p>You can alter the buffer times by defining new buffering policies and you can alter when the
			initial buffering occurs by using instant-on. </p>
