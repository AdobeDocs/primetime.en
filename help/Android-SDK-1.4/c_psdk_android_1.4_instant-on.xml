  <title>Instant on</title> 
  <shortdesc>The term instant on refers to preloading one or more channels so
	 that a user selecting a channel or switching channels sees content playing
	 immediately. The buffering is already done by the time the user starts
	 watching. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p> Without instant on, <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> initializes the media to be
			played but does not start buffering the stream until the application calls
				<codeph>play</codeph>. The user sees no content until buffering is complete. With
			instant on, you can launch multiple media player (or media-player item loader)
			instances, and <ph conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> starts buffering the streams
			immediately. </p> 
	 <p>When a user changes the channel and the stream has buffered properly,
		calling 
		<codeph>play</codeph> on the new channel starts playback immediately. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Although there are no limits to the number of <codeph>MediaPlayer</codeph> instances that <ph
				conkeyref="phrases/primetime-sdk-name"/> can run, running more instances consumes
			more resources. Application performance can be affected by the number of instances
			running. For more information about these instances, see <xref
				keyref="media-resource-load-using-mediaplayeritemloader"/>. </p>
