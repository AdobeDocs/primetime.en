# Catalog format

The Primetime reference implementation uses a JSON-based feed format for responses. This format is parsed using an implementation of the IFeedItemAdapter interface.


>[!NOTE]
>
>This feed format is the sample format that the reference implementation uses and serves as an example of how the format can be parsed and mapped to the feed interface. You can use your own input feed format with your own feed interface implementations.


At a high-level, the format consists of an array of content entries. Each entry represents a live or VOD published video content: 

```
{
    "entries": [
        {
        },
        {
        },
        ...
    ]
}

```


Each feed entry is a JSON object with a given set of attributes: 

```
{
    "entries": [
        
            "id": "episode1",
            "title": "My episode1",
            "description": "This is an episode.",
            "categories": "documentary, educational, children",
            "keywords": "List, of, comma, separated, keywords",
            "isLive": false,
            "content":  [
                
                },
                
                },
            ],
            "thumbnails": [
                
                },
                
                }
            ]
            "metadata": 
            } 
        }
    ]
}

```


|  Property  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `id`  | A unique identifier/guide for the content as set by the feed publishing system.  |
| `title`  | A title for the content.  |
| `description`  | A description of the content.  |
| `categories`  | A list of categories tagged for the content that can be used by the application to enhance the user's experience. Read into the properties for the content.  |

| `isLive`  | true or false, indicating if it is a Live or VOD stream.  |
| `content`  | An array of JSON objects with alternate formats for the content along with the corresponding URLs. For example, there could be urls for the f4m and m3u8 formats. The JSON object attributes are described further below.  |
| `thumbnails`  | An array of JSON objects with urls for different sizes of thumbnails. The JSON object attributes are defined below.  |
| `metadata`  | A JSON object defining metadata for the content, currently this metadata is limited to ad related metadata. The metadata object is defined below.  |

The following code block defines the JSON objects that form the array of **content objects**: 

```
