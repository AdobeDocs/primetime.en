# Video Analytics

You can easily track video by integrating a TVSDK-based app with your Adobe Analytics account.



The integration of Adobe Primetime TVSDK with Adobe Analytics allows you to track video data in your Android applications. This integration between the TVSDK is referred to herein as *video analytics*. 


This section of the reference implementation guide summarizes how video analytics has been implemented in the Primetime Android Reference Implementation, and describes how you can enable and configure video analytics in your TVSDK-based player based on the reference implementation. 


The video analytics implementation is disabled by default in the reference implementation. Before you can track video data, you need to have a working Adobe Analytics account. You then have to configure the video analytics component of the reference implementation with your Adobe Analytics account information.
