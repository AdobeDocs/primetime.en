# Enable video playback

Create a PlaybackManager that handles the HLS stream setup and playback operation. No other configuration is required.


1. Create the media player object by making sure the following code exists in [!DNL PlayerFragment.java]:

   ```
   java   private MediaPlayer createMediaPlayer() { 
           MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = DefaultMediaPlayer.create(getActivity().getApplicationContext()); 
           return mediaPlayer;
   ```

   <!-- I've duplicated this information. It also exists in the PlayerFragment section, just before the Feature manager section. I figured that I should have it here as well, in case they jump directly to this section. -->

1. Create the playback manager through the `ManagerFactory`:

   ```
   java   playbackManager = ManagerFactory.getPlaybackManager(config, mediaPlayer);
   ```

1. Implement the `PlaybackManagerEventListener` in the `PlayerFragment` to handle the playback events:

   ```
   java   private final PlaybackManagerEventListener playbackManagerEventListener =  
     new PlaybackManagerEventListener() 
   ```

1. Register the event listener in the `PlayerFragment`:

   ```
   playbackManager.addEventListener(playbackManagerEventListener);
   ```

1. Set up the video resource:

   ```
   playbackManager.setupVideo(url, adsManager); 
   ```

1. Set up the control bar operations in the `PlayerFragment`:

   ```
   controlBar.pressPlay() { 
       playbackManager.play();  
   }
   ```
