# DRM content protection

The Primetime player supports Primetime DRM integration as custom DRM workflows. This means that your application must implement the DRM authentication workflows before playing the stream.



To enable this, TVSDK provides you with the DRM manager for authentication. The reference implementation provides an example of the following workflows: 
* How to load and play back HLS streams with Access content protection, optimized for low error rates and quick start up.
* How to load and play back HLS streams with AES128 content protection.
* How to load and play back HLS streams with PHLS content protection, optimized for low error rates and quick start up.





All DRM-protected content is handled automatically by the DRM libraries built into the TVSDK. However, you can expose error handling, optimization of device individualization, and license acquisition using TVSDK API callbacks.
