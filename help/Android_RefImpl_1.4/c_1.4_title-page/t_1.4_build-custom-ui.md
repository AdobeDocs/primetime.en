# Build a custom user interface

You can easily build a custom user interface based on the reference implementation framework.



The UI components of the following features are already integrated: 
* Clickable ads
* Ad overlays
* Late-binding audio
* Closed captions
* Listeners for all of the above components




1. Edit the [!DNL PlayerFragment.java] file to initialize the UI components that you want to use in your player.


1. Edit the [!DNL res/player/player_fragment.xml] file to customize the user interface.
1. Build the project.

>[!NOTE]

>To make UI changes to the seek bar, you can edit the [MarkableSeekBar](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/reference_implementation/android/javadoc/com/adobe/primetime/reference/ui/player/MarkableSeekBar.html) class. The `MarkableSeekBar` class handles the slider, thumb of the slider, ad marker holder, cue markers, buffer range, and seek range backgrounds.
