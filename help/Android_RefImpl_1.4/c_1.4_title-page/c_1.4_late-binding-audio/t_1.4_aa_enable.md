# Integrate late-binding audio

You can integrate late-binding or alternate audio streams into your player by creating an alternate audio feature manager.


* To create an alternate audio manager:

  ```java
  AAManager aaManager = new AAManagerOn(); 
  ```

* To use the ManagerFactory to enable alternate audio, make sure the following line of code is in the `PlayerFragment.java` file:

  ```java
  aaManager = ManagerFactory.getAAManager( 
<b>true</b>, config, mediaPlayer);
  ```


  To disable alternate audio: 


  ```java
  aaManager = ManagerFactory.getAAManager( 
<b>false</b>, config, mediaPlayer);
  ```
