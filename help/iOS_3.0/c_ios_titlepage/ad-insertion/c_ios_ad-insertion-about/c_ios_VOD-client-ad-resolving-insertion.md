# VOD ad resolving and insertion

TVSDK supports several use cases for VOD ad resolving and insertion.

In VOD, TVSDK supports the following use cases: 

* Pre-roll ad insertion, where ads are inserted at the beginning of the content.* Mid-roll ad insertion, where at least one ad is inserted in the middle of the content.* Post-roll ad insertion, where at least one ad is appended at the end of the content.

TVSDK resolves the ads, inserts the ads in locations defined by the ad server, and computes the virtual timeline before playback starts. After playback starts, no changes, such as ads being inserted or inserted ads being removed, can occur.
