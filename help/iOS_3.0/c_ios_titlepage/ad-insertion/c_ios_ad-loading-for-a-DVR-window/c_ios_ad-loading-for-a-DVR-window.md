# Ad loading for a DVR window

You can decide whether to resolve only the ads that occur after the user’s current live point or to also resolve ads that occur before the current live point.

When a user starts to view content at the beginning of a DVR stream, TVSDK resolves all ads for the stream at that time. However, when the user starts to view content at a point after the beginning of the stream, you can decide whether to resolve only the ads that occur after the user’s current live point or to also resolve ads that occurred before the current live point. 

>[!TIP]
>
>Resolving ads after the current live point is faster, but if the user seeks backwards, this option prevents the player from playing ads that appeared earlier.
