# Control closed-caption styling{#control-closed-caption-styling}

You can provide styling information for closed-caption tracks using the TextFormat class. This sets the style for any closed captions that are displayed by your player.

This class encapsulates closed-caption styling information such as the font type, size, color, and background opacity. An associated helper class, `TextFormatBuilder`, facilitates working with closed-caption style settings.
