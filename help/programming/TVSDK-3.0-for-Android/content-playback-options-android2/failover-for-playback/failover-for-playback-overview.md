>Primetime cannot protect from failures such as an ISP outage or a cable disconnection.

Primetime streaming provides failover protection to protect playback from certain remote server failures or operational failures, which makes a better viewing experience. Despite transmission problems, TVSDK implements failover protection to minimize playback interruptions and achieve a seamless playback. The video player automatically switches to a backup media set when entire renditions or fragments are unavailable.
