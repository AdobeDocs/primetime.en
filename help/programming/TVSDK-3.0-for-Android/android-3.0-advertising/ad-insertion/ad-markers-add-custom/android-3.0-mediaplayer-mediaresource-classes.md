# MediaPlayer and MediaResource classes{#mediaplayer-and-mediaresource-classes}

A MediaResource represents the content that is about to be loaded by the MediaPlayer instance.

<a id="section_431AB7221E0249BF949EC72EEB9B428A"></a>

TVSDK provides the means to load and prepare content for playback by using the `replaceCurrentResource` method in `MediaPlayer`. This method takes two arguments, an instance of `MediaPlayerResource` and, optionally, an instance of `MediaPlayerItemConfig`, which you can use to pass application-defined custom parameters.
