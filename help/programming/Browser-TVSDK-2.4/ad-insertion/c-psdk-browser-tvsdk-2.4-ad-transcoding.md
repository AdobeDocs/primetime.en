# Repackage (transcode) incompatible ads{#repackage-transcode-incompatible-ads}

Some third-party ads (or creatives) cannot be stitched into the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)/Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) content stream because their video format is incompatible with HLS/DASH. Adobe Primetime ad insertion and Browser TVSDK can optionally attempt to repackage (transcode) incompatible videos into compatible m3u8/mpd videos.

Ads served from various third parties, such as an agency ad server, your inventory partner, or an ad network, are often delivered in incompatible formats, such as progressive-download MP4.
